[unsetenvironment]
# Defines environment variables to be removed from the service reading
# the configuration file. Supported formats are:
#
# 1. <variableName>=
# 2. <serviceName>.<variableName>=
#
# Where <serviceName> refers to the 'vmsvc' and 'vmusr',
# <variableName> refers to the name of the environment
# variable to be removed. '=' sign after <variableName>
# is mandatory to maintain the configuration file syntax.
# However, anything after '=' is ignored.
#
# Case-sensitive behavior is defined by the operating system.
#
# Note: unsetenvironment group is processed before setenvironment group.
# As the service environment is setup at start up time, any changes
# in this group require service to be restarted in order to take effect.
#
# Unsetting PATH for all services:
# PATH=
#
# Unsetting PATH for vmsvc only:
# vmsvc.PATH=
#
# Unsetting PATH for vmusr only:
# vmusr.PATH=

[setenvironment]
# Defines environment variables to be set for the service reading
# the configuration file. Supported formats are:
#
# 1. <variableName>=<variableValue>
# 2. <serviceName>.<variableName>=<variableValue>
#
# Where <serviceName> refers to the 'vmsvc' and 'vmusr',
# <variableName> refers to the name of the environment
# variable to be set, and <variableValue> refers to the
# value to be assigned to the environment variable.
#
# Case-sensitive behavior is defined by the operating system.
#
# Note: setenvironment group is processed after unsetenvironment group.
# As the service environment is setup at start up time, any changes
# in this group require service to be restarted in order to take effect.

# for Linux, MacOS and Solaris.

# Possible values for handler are:
# file: logs to a file. Set *.data to the file name
# file+: same as 'file', but appends to the file
#  All file paths used in *.data value need to be in Unix
#  format (forward slashes) and in utf-8, for all operating
#  systems.
# vmx: logs to the host (ESXi, Workstation, Fusion)
# std: Logs to stdout for level >= 'message',
# and to stderr for more severe than 'message'.
# syslog: logs to syslog
# outputdebugstring: uses OutputDebugString (Windows only)

# If handler is 'syslog' and the OS is Linux, the facility
# can be set with <domain>.facility. The facility value can be one of
# 'local0'..'local7', 'daemon' or 'user'. The default is 'user'.

# default setting post diagnosis.
