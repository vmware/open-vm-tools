    OVT: Build only fuse-based or kernel module vmblocktest programs.
    
    The OVT configuration determines whether open-vm-tools will build
    a vmblock kernel module or a vmblock-fuse user level VMBlock
    implementation.  Both versions of the vmblocktest program(s) are not
    needed.   Linux OVT is only using the vmblock-fuse implementation.
    
    Select the version to build based on the HAVE_FUSE setting from the
    ./configure run.
    
    This fixes https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/467

    Fix propagation of libtirpc flags into build of test source.
    
    Starting with glibc 2.32, the Linux libc<n>-dev no longer provides
    the /usr/include/rpc/rpc.h header.  The configure script will detect
    the availability of the libtirpc package and use the rpc.h header
    from /usr/include/tirpc/rpc/rpc.h.
    
    This fix extends the necessary compilation and linking options to the
    build of the open-vm-tools services test programs that utilize RPC.

    Fix memory leaks.
    
    A Coverity scan of open-vm-tools reported a number of memory leaks
    on error code paths.  Fix seven reported leaks, and modify code
    to address two false positives in order to make the code clearer
    and/or keep Coverity from reporting the issues.  Also fix additional
    leaks found in the routine Proto_TextContents during code review.

    hostinfo.h: stop including x86cpuid.h
    
    With the removal of Hostinfo_GetAllCpuid in an earlier change, hostinfo.h
    can stop including x86cpuid.h and only needs vendor IDs from x86vendor.h.
    
    Unfortunately, quite a few source files depended in hostinfo.h's automatic
    inclusion of x86cpuid.h. Fix them to include what they need.
    
    The lib/include/guestStats.h is a special case that happened to succeed because
    of a warning that was disabled in x86cpuid.h which also happens to have
    been included earlier than this header.  Re-disable the warning.

    LOG: Keep the LOG_LEVEL entries sorted
    
    This is the first in a series of changes to the Log Facility that will add
    the ability to have domain specific filtering (e.g. foobar domain can have
    log calls which are filtered by domain (name) and level).  This will make
    LOG like abilities usable in all build types, even a release build.
    
    The LOG_LEVEL entries are difficult to find since they are in a jumbled
    order.  The existing grouping isn't useful as many of the modules are shared.
    Create one big sorted list.

    Add --cmdfile argument
    
    Some OSes (Windows) have a relatively small cmdline limit.
    Expose a cmdfile argument which works like --cmd, but
    reads the input from a file.  This allows RPCs which can
    have huge arguments (guestVars, namespaceDB, DataSets) to work.

    [HGFS Server] Add file attributes/symlink check status cache using oplock support
    
    An investigation found that while copying a group of small files from host
    to guest using the shared folder, the HGFS_OP_GETATTR_V3 message was handled
    in HGFS server 276,140 times over a period of ~35 seconds.
    
    Caching the file attributes in HGFS on the server-side can reduce the time
    significantly (from experimental results, 35s => 8s).
    
    It was also discovered that Posix_RealPath is called repeatedly to check
    whether a path is a symlink, since HgfsServerGetLocalNameInfo is called when
    handling a series of requests.
    
    Integrate a key-value cache to HGFS server to cache the symlink check results
    and file attributes, using the file path as the key.  This task will be divided
    into multiple change:
    
    1. Add oplock support
    2. Add a customized LRU cache in HGFS server for file attributes and
       symlink check results
    
    -  New files:
       hgfsCache.h/c: implements a customized LRU cache which is built by
                      combining two data structures: a doubly linked list and
                      a hash table.
    
    -  The cache will be allocated only when oplock is enabled.
    -  The cache relies on the file change monitor provided by oplock to ensure
       there is no stale data.  When adding an entry into the cache, also
       register the file change callback to oplock.  Upon receiving the file change
       callback, invalidate the cache.  Once the cache is full, remove the LRU
       entry and unregister the file change callback for it.

    [HGFS Server] Support oplock inside HGFS server for Windows host

Date:   Fri Aug 7 12:03:24 2020 -0700

    [HGFS Server] Support oplock inside HGFS server for Windows host
    
    The motivation for this change is to cache file/directory related information
    in host side, for example the file/directory attributes.  To make the cache
    correct, we will use the oplock(Windows)/lease(Linux) to monitor the
    file/directory change event.  When the file/directory changes, the item in
    cache will be invalidated.
    
    In this change, two new functions are defined:
    - HgfsOplockMonitorFileChange
       This function is used to monitor the change event for a file/directory,
       and the callback will be called if file/directory is changed.
    - HgfsOplockUnmonitorFileChange
       This function is used to cancel the change event monitoring.
    
    This patch only implements the oplock support for Windows host, the support
    for Linux will be delivered in another patch.

    GOSC event doesn't report at once after customization process timer is reached
    
    When process timer is reached, the command process is killed and function
    ProcessRead is called to read all the output till EOF.  But EOF can't be
    reached immediately.  The reason is pre-customization script is launched
    by perl script, and killing perl script process doesn't kill the
    pre-customization script process.
    This code update includes:
    1. Do not read stdout/stderr when gosc command process exits abnormally
       to avoid the EOF blocking.
    2. Add READSTATUS_PENDING_TO_EOF in enum ReadStatus to avoid the confusion
       with READSTATUS_PENDING.
    3. Close the write ends of pipes (stdout[1]/stderr[1]) for child command
       process before it exists.
    4. In processPosix.c, the write ends of pipes have been closed in line 180,
       181, so the read ends should be closed in line 254, 255.
    5. Add explicit note for the beginning and the end of the perl script log.

    Fix memory leak issue for "vmtoolsd" binary on receiving SIGINT or SIGUSR1.
    
    Valgrind complains of a memory leak issue on receiving SIGINT or SIGUSR1
    signal, because we lost call to RpcIn_Destruct(chan->in) in
    RpcChannelTeardown().  It just happens to be released only at service
    shutdown or on receiving SIGUSR1 signal; not a major concern.
    Cleaning up the code.

    hostinfoPosix: remove NOT_IMPLEMENTED() when NO_IOPL
    
    When running "vmtoolsd -b pidfile" on Linux arm64, we hit this error:
    
       [error] [vmsvc] NOT_IMPLEMENTED hostinfoPosix.c:2526
    
    Linux arm64 does not implement iopl() and the Hostinfo_ResetProcessState()
    is raising a NOT_IMPLEMENTED() because of that.  However if there's no iopl(),
    there is no reason to drop IO privileges, so we can just skip that code.
    
    This change also restores usage of getloadavg() for non Android arm64
    platforms: ESX vmx and tools for Linux arm64.

    Code cleanup to address a Coverity issue.
    
    Coverity reports a "dereference after NULL check" in
    BkdoorChannelStart.  However, at the point of dereference
    it's known that chan->inStarted is TRUE, which means chan->in
    is guaranteed to be non-NULL, so it's not a bug.
    
    Still, given that an input channel, if present, must have been
    started before calling BkdoorChannelStart, it's possible to do
    some code cleanup that will also get Coverity to stop reporting
    the issue.  Change what's currently a test into an ASSERT, test
    chan->in rather than chan->inStarted, and add comments to make
    it clearer what's going on.

    Improve Linux guest identification function documentation.
    
    Make it clear that the "short name" of a Linux distro has a default
    value and that the default value should not be overwritten unless
    VMware does this.
    
    If someone cheats and sends down an unsupported "short name", the
    guestMapper will protect the software stack, mapping the unsupported
    "short name" to that of the guestOS config found in the VMX file.
    We know that is OK since the VM couldn't power on and run the guest
    unless it was valid.
    
    All older, supported ESXi have updates that contain the guestMapper.
    
    If the guestMapper is not in place - an older, unpatched release -
    the software stack can become confused causing problems and crashes.

    tree.
    
    * Moved the appInfo.h and serviceDiscovery.h to a different location.
    
    * Made necessary code and OVT changes to refer to new file paths.
    
    * Did some cleanup related to the MACRO names for the keys and scripts.

    Fix a Coverity-reported NULL pointer issue.
    
    Check whether a pointer is NULL before dereferencing it.  Also
    updated a stale comment, edited a couple of other comments for
    line length, and deleted some trailing white space.

    serviceDiscovery: Updating 'get-versions.sh' script
    
    The following changes have been made:
    
    1. Environment variable 'ALIVE_BASE' is used to construct the path of
       the file where vcops version is stored.  The variable is not avialable
       when running the script inside serviceDiscovery plugin process, so a
       hardcoded path is used.
    
    2. Added command to retrieve tcserver version

    Deprecate VMGuestLib_GetHostMemKernOvhdMB GuestSDK API.
    
    * GUESTLIB_HOST_MEM_KERN_OVHD_MB metric was already deprecated in ESXi
      starting from 7.1.  It's time to deprecate the corresponding
      VMGuestLib_GetHostMemKernOvhdMB API in GuestSDK.  The documentation
      will be update denoting that this API is deprecated.
      After one or two releases, the API will be removed completely.
      Untill then, the API is modified to explicity return 0 for the metric.
    
    * Only a few functions listed in vmGuestLib.h are exposed in the vmGuestLibJava
      interface.  The remaining functions are encapsulated in '#ifndef SWIG'
      to hide them from SWIG utility which is used to generate the Java bindings.
    
    Note: The external customer facing documentation for this API will be
          documented later.
    Note: Once this changeset is submitted, the vmStatsProvider module
          will be updated to stop using the deprecated API.

    GuestSDK and vmtoolslib cleanup.
    
    * Removed the vmtools dependency for guestsdk.  This has been already
      done for tar tools build/target.  The same is being done for OVT
      builds.
    
    * Used various static libraries for building guestlib in OVT instead of
      depending on vmtoolslib.  Similar thing has already been done for
      appmonitor library in OVT.
    
    * GuestSDK_{Panic|Debug|Warning|Log} functions in vmtoolslib are not used
      anywhere and hence they are completely removed from the code.

    Improve logging on signature verification
    
    If xmlsec and vgauth are built inconsistently, xmlSecSize
    can differ between the two, which results in a key datastructure
    being a different size, and vgauth ends up looking in the
    wrong place in memory for the signature check status.
    
    Log the status, so that if its not one of the two
    expected values, we have some ideas of what went wrong.

    lib/file: Fix a memory leak in FileLock_Lock.
    
    Valgrind complained about a minor leak within FileLock_Lock when running
    test-vmx Firmware.Efi.QuickBoot .  FileLockScanner builds a list of "active
    locks" and traverses that list repeatedly, but whenever it decides to remove
    an entry from the list, it would simply leak it.
    
    This change ensures that the list item is not leaked by Posix_Free()ing it
    once it is no longer needed.

    Hgfs Linux/OSX Server: fix write-only shares access check creating new files
    
    Linux and OS X Hgfs server has an incorrect failure status check when a

    is mapped to EACESS unless the error is ENOENT when a new file is to be
    created.  The error check currently fails all errors when it should
    only allow creation of new files i.e., ENOENT with flags specifying
    O_CREAT.
    
    The check should be

    [AppInfo] Tweak the gather loop only for a real config reload.
    
    The poll loop for the appInfo is being tweaked (destroyed and recreated)
    for every conf reload even when nothing related to appinfo changed.
    This may cause few scenarios where the 'application information'
    will never be collected inside the guest.  Fixed the code, to
    tweak the loop only when there is a real appinfo related config change
    in the tools.conf file.

    At few places in the code, the result from the RPC channel send APIs

    have a well defined macro for that.  Changed the code to re-use the macro
    wherever possible.

    In error cases, RpcChannel Send APIs (RpcChannel_SendOneRaw,

    This changeset adds the MACRO for that error message.
    
    If there are any callers who compare the results (ex: ServiceDiscovery), they
    don't have to use 'hardcoded' messages and can reuse the MACROs.

    Use random poll-interval for appInfo on channel reset.
    
    In few workflows like instant clone, when a large number of VMs are
    cloned at the same time, if the appinfo plugin runs at the same time
    in all the VMs, the underlying ESXi may encounter heavy load.  To
    avoid these situations, a random poll interval should be used
    for the appinfo whenever applicable workflows are detected.
    
    Detecting a 'rpc channel reset' is a simple approach to detect.
    
    In this changeset, add the following changes:
    
    - Added a new callback function for the 'rpc channel reset'.  If
    the rpc channel is reset, a new random poll interval is calculated
    and poll timer is adjusted accordingly.  If the existing appinfo
    poll interval is greater than the minimum interval of 30 seconds,
    random interval will be generated between 30 and appinfopollinterval.
    If the existing poll interval is less than the minimum 30 seconds
    time, then random interval will not be changed.
    
    - Code refactoring for few functions.
    - Changed one global variable as static.
    - Added few debug/info log messages.

    Make Backdoor fallback temporary.
    
    When RpcOut falls to Backdoor, it stays with Backdoor
    permanently for the life of vmtoolsd service.  It is a
    long standing bug in the reset handling code.  Typically,
    channel type is not changed during reset.  Our reset
    handling code can either keep the channel type same or
    switch it from vsocket to Backdoor, but it can't do other
    way.  Though it is supposed to switch to vsocket on reset
    caused by events like vmtoolsd being restarted or VMX
    breaking the channel for some VM management operation.
    With this change when we start the channel, we always
    try vsocket first unless Backdoor is enforced by the
    caller.
    
    Using Backdoor for too long is not desirable because
    privileged RPCs can't be used on such channel.  So, we
    need to retry switching the channel back to vsocket
    periodically.  We don't want to try vsocket on every
    RpcChannel_Send call because that adds to overhead and
    increases the latency of RpcChannel_Send due to connection
    timeouts.  So, we retry vsocket with a backoff delay
    between 2sec-5min.
    
    As some RpcChannel callers intend to use Backdoor channel
    we need to differentiate between such usage from the
    callers that create vsocket channel and fallback to
    Backdoor.  Therefore, introduced a concept of mutable
    channel.  The vsocket channel is mutable as it can fallback
    to Backdoor and restore vsocket.  However, if a caller
    creates Backdoor channel, it will not be mutable and
    stay with Backdoor for its lifetime.
    
    As vmxLogger frequently connects and disconnects the
    channel for every log message and does not use any
    privileged RPC, so make it use Backdoor channel
    permanently to avoid frequent vsocket connections.
    
    Additionally, removed the redundant 'stopRpcOut' interface
    and renamed 'onStartErr' to 'destroy'.

    Add a retry loop to VSockChannelStart() to recover on start failure.
    
    On failure, a vsock RPC channel will eventually fallback to the
    backdoor channel.  Services that require or are limited to the
    priviledge RPC channel will fail.
    
    Adding a simple, limited loop in VSockChannelStart to retry the vsock
    channel start before ultimately switching to the backdoor channel.
    Retries are not done for "send once" operations.

	Other changes not captured in the git logs:

	* Resync with internal dev branch (2009.08.24)

	* hgfsmounter/hgfsmounter.c: allow hgfs users to set ttl to 0 at mount time.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, lib/include/conf.h, lib/include/netutil.h,
	  lib/include/procMgr.h, lib/include/system.h, lib/vixTools/vixTools.c,
	  lib/vmCheck/vmcheck.c: remove (now unused) Netware checks.

	* lib/message/*, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/Makefile,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/Makefile.*, modules/solaris/vmhgfs/Makefile: remove
	  unused message transport abstraction. The rpcChannel library is now used to
	  do RPC abstraction.

	* modules/*/vmmemctl/*: refactor of the vmmemctl module as part of adding
	  support for Mac OS guests.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c: don't clobber RESERVATION_CONFLICT sdstat
	  up from linux pvscsi driver.

	* modules/linux/shared/*: VMCI changes unrelated to the guest driver.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c: fix the case
	  where two directories refer to the same inode.

	* scripts/linux/*: support older versions of NetworkManager.

2009-08-24	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.08.19)

	* configure.ac: remove support for Linux kernels < 2.6.9.

	* lib/include/vmtools.h, libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c, doc/api/services/util.txt:
	  add new log handled that allows appending to existing log files, and fix
	  an issue where old log files would be "rotated" whenever the config file
	  was reloaded.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c, lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c,
	  lib/include/appUtil.h: fix compilation issues on FreeBSD when unity
	  was enabled.

	* lib/dnd/dndLinux.c, lib/include/vmblock_user.h, tests/testVmblock/*: add
	  vmblock tests and, as part of the change, do some refactoring of vmblock
	  related functions.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/*,
	  toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c, toolbox/toolboxShrink.c: refactor the wiper
	  structures so that they behave the same on Win32 and other platforms, and
	  also reuse data structures already in use by other parts of the code. This
	  fixes an "use after free" issue that toolbox-cmd had on Win32.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoInt.h,
	  lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c, lib/guestRpc/nicinfo.x,
	  lib/include/guestInfo.h, lib/include/netutil.h, lib/include/slashProc.h,
	  lib/netutil/netUtilLinux.c, lib/slashProc/*,
	  services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: add support for sending more
	  network-related information to the host, such as routing tables and name
	  servers.

	* lib/hgfsBd/hgfsBd.c: don't log RPC errors when HGFS is disabled.

	* lib/hgfsHelper/*, lib/include/hgfsHelper.h, lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: new
	  library with functions to query information about HGFS; expose some HGFS
	  properties through VIX.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/hgfsServerPolicyGuest/hgfsServerPolicyGuest.c,
	  lib/include/hgfsServerPolicy.h: fix checking of whether an object belongs
	  to a particular share; this was causing issues with invalid information
	  being returned in certain cases.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/include/hgfsProto.h: changes to support new VIX API
	  calls (mostly affecting Win32 only).

	* lib/include/guestCaps.h, lib/include/unityCommon.h: add boilerplate for new
	  RPCs for setting windows as sticky / non-sticky (not yet implemented).

	* lib/include/hgfsProto.h: new definitions for the next version of the HGFS
	  protocol.

	* lib/include/xdrutil.h: make XDRUTIL_ARRAYAPPEND() more type-safe when using
	  GCC.

	* lib/misc/codesetOld.c: fix some issues with UTF16 -> UTF8 conversion.

	* lib/rpcChannel/rpcChannel.c, libvmtools/signalSource.c,
	  libvmtools/vmtools.c, libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: g_assert -> ASSERT.

	* lib/unityWindowTracker/unityWindowTracker.c: fix issue with z-ordering of
	  modal dialogs.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: fix some old config translation issues.

	* modules/freebsd/shared/*, modules/freebsd/vmblock/*: make vmblock work on
	  FreeBSD 8.

	* modules/freebsd/vmmemctl/*, modules/linux/vmmemctl/*,
	  modules/solaris/vmmemctl/*, : refactoring and code changes to support the
	  driver on Mac OS X.

	* modules/linux/vmblock/*, modules/linux/vmci/*, modules/linux/vsock/linux/*:
	  remove compatibility code for older kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: fix memory leak in HgfsAccessInt().

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: fix kunmap usage in vmxnet3_shm, and reset the
	  shared pages when the char device is closed.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.{c,h}, modules/linux/vsock/linux/util.c:
	  add vsock protocol negotiation for notifyOn ops. This allows the driver to
	  negotiate with the remove end which version of the notification protocol to
	  use.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/notify.c, modules/linux/vsock/linux/notify.h,
	  modules/linux/vsock/linux/notifyQState.c,
	  modules/linux/vsock/linux/vsockPacket.h: add pktOn protocol. This new
	  protocol improves performance by detecting changes in the queue state
	  instead of sending WAITING_READ and WAITING_WRITE packets.

	* services/plugins/hgfsServer/hgfsPlugin.c,
	  services/plugins/resolutionSet/resolutionSet.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: load plugins even when an RPC channel cannot
	  be instantiated (i.e., when running outside of a virtual machine); this
	  allows plugins to perform actions (at load time) also when running outside
	  virtual machines (e.g., to undo some configuration done when the OS was run
	  in a VM).

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: handle SIGHUP differently; instead of
	  stopping the service, just re-load the config data. This should make it
	  easier to integrate the tools service with other tools such as logrotate.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c, toolbox/toolboxcmd-stat.c: remove memory info query,
	  which didn't really return useful information.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.cpp: if the clipboard/primary with most recent
	  timestamp has no data on it, try the other before giving up during
	  copy/paste.

2009-07-22	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.07.17)

	* configure.ac: fix detection of "dot" and its usage in the doxygen config
	  file.

	* configure.ac, libguestlib/Makefile.am, libguestlib/vmguestlib.pc.in:
	  install vmguestlib headers and add new pkgconfig script.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/include/dndBase.h, vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}:
	  fix an issue where the DnD code would prevent drops to other windows in
	  Unity mode, instead of just intercepting drops to the desktop.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/dndGuest/dndRpc.hh, lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc,
	  lib/include/dndBase.h, vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}: fix an issue where the
	  host Unity code would cause an undesired drop event.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/dndGuest/dndRpc.hh, lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc,
	  lib/include/dndBase.h: cleanup mouse simulation code, and fix an issue
	  where a drag would be canceled if the contents were dragged out of a guest
	  and then back in.

	* lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc, vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.cpp,
	  vmware-user/dndUI.cpp, vmware-user/dndUI.h, vmware-user/dragDetWnd.cpp,
	  vmware-user/dragDetWnd.h: several DnD fixes; make the DnD code behave
	  more like other GTK applications (based on analysing the flow of signals
	  on a test widget), and get rid of one of the detection windows, merging
	  both the Unity and non-Unity windows. Also, some code refactoring.

	* lib/ghIntegration/*, lib/guestRpc/*, lib/include/guestCaps.h,
	  lib/include/unityCommon.h: add stubs for a few new GHI functions (setting
	  window focus, tray icon updates and enhanced app info) - currently only
	  implemented on Win32.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: examine WM_CLASS when determining
	  which DE Tools are running in. The previous code was failing to show a
	  few entries set as "OnlyShowIn=xxx" because checking WM_NAME wasn't enough
	  to properly detect the desktop environment in certain cases.

	* lib/guestApp/guestAppPosixX11.c: use gconftool-2 to detect the user's
	  browser, since gnome-open fails to open "file://" URLs which contain query
	  strings. Also, use "kde-open" when running under KDE.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c:
	  allow shrinking LVM partitions.

	* lib/include/appUtil.h: partial refactoring of icon retrieval code.

	* lib/include/dbllnklst.h, lib/misc/dbllnklst.c: inline linked list
	  functions.

	* lib/include/guest_os.h, lib/misc/hostinfoPosix.c: add a couple of
	  distros to the known distro list.

	* lib/include/netutil.h, lib/netUtil/netUtilLinux.c: add Linux interface
	  name, index lookup routines.

	* lib/include/system.h, lib/system/systemLinux.c,
	  services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c: fixes a few bugs in the backwards
	  time sync code, mostly due to unit mismatches.

	* lib/include/unityWindowTracker.h, lib/unity/unity.c,
	  lib/unity/unityPlatform.h, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unityWindowTracker/unityWindowTracker.c: expose two new properties in
	  the window tracker to save an RPC to retrieve those properties.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: add
	  support for "application providers", which allow plugins to add support to
	  new kinds of application frameworks through vmtoolsd.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: only enable GIO channels when Unity is
	  actually active.

	* lib/unity/*: cleanup old GTK1 code.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: don't complain if config file is empty.

	* modules/linux/dkms.conf, modules/linux/dkms.sh: fix dkms.conf, and provide
	  a script to create a dkms tree from open-vm-tools.

	* modules/linux/shared/vmci_queue_pair.h, modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c:
	  remove two (now) unneeded functions.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: code cleanups, properly initialize the list head,
	  and allow receives to timeout so that hibernation works.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c: fix
	  drivers for kernels 2.6.29+.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: add shared memory support for faster communication
	  between user space and the device backend; this doesn't affect the regular
	  driver functionality, but is used by some VMware code not part of Tools.

	* modules/linux/vsock/*: fix an issue where it was possible for users to send
	  VMCI datagrams directly to the hypervisor.

	* scripts/common/vmware-user.desktop: work around a bug in KDE where desktop
	  files with "NoDisplay" fail to autostart.

	* scripts/freebsd/suspend-vm-default: use netif to bring down interfaces,
	  since dhclient doesn't understand "-r" in the default install.

	* services/plugins/vmbackup/*: add some new code used by enhancements being
	  done in the Win32 version of the plugin.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: fix running in background when executing
	  vmtoolsd while relying on PATH.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am: point to the correct plugin install
	  directory.

	* toolbox/*: better command line handling in the CLI utility, plus some code
	  cleanup.

	* vmware-user/copyPaste.c, vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.cpp,
	  vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.h, vmware-user/dnd.c: properly unregister
	  RPCs to avoid multiple registrations (and the ensuing ASSERT) in certain
	  cases.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h}: change way data is retrieved from the
	  clipboard, using the gtk+ clipboard wait APIs (which turn out to be more
	  reliable than the previous approach).

2009-06-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.06.15)

	* docs/api/Makefile.am: replace all variables in the doxygen conf file with
	  the correct values.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c: try alternate file extensions during icon search.
	  Sometimes a package lists its icon as icon-foo.png, but the package didn't
	  include icon-foo.png.	 Instead, it included icon-foo.xpm.	 Ex: Ubuntu
	  8.04's hwtest.

	* lib/guestApp/guestAppPosixX11.c: change detection of the default browser so
	  that the new help system works; the help files are not yet available in
	  open-vm-tools.

	* lib/hgfs/*, lib/include/cpName.h, lib/include/cpNameLite.h,
	  lib/include/hgfsUtil.h: avoid compiling certain parts of the source in
	  kernel modules.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*: return correct error when files / directories don't
	  exist.

	* lib/include/hgfsChannel.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: added support for vsock
	  channel for HGFS.

	* lib/include/util.h, lib/misc/utilMem.c: un-inline a bunch of functions to
	  reduce the size of binaries.

	* lib/include/vm_tools_version.h: bumped Tools version.

	* lib/resolution/resolutionX11.c: fix for issue where the host would send
	  a "topology set" command with a top-left corner that was not (0, 0) and
	  cause the screen to be reconfigured in the wrong way.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c: check for errors in calls to
	  XQueryTree.

	* lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c: check return of fgets() to avoid compiler warnings.

	* libvmtools/vmtools.c: fix initialization of wiper library on Win32.

	* modules/Makefile.am: install vsock header file on Linux.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/*, modules/linux/vmci/*, modules/linux/vsock/*:
	  changes related to 64-bit Mac drivers, don't affect either the FreeBSD
	  or Linux drivers.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/hgfs.h: removed duplicate file.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/module.h: fix issue where two files would get the
	  same inode number in some situations.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c: re-probe vmxnet2 device features on resume
	  from hibernate, to cover the case where a VM is resumed on a platform with
	  a different version of the device backend (bug #2209565).

	* scripts/resume-vm-default, scripts/suspend-vm-default: use NetworkManager
	  to handle networking where it is available.

	* services/plugins/hgfsServer/Makefile.am, services/plugins/vix/Makefile.am:
	  fix installation of vmusr plugins that are shared with vmsvc.

	* services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c: fix backwards time sync.

	* services/vmtoolsd/cmdLine.c, toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: print build number as
	  part of "-v" output.

	* toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c: correctly ignore unsupported partitions when
	  shrinking.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: changes for the new help system, not yet available
	  for open-vm-tools.

	* toolbox/toolboxInt.{c,h}, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: some code refactoring.

	* vmware-user/Makefile.am: fix linking when compiling without gtkmm.

2009-05-22	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.05.18)

	* configure.ac, m4/vmtools.m4: check for PAM and enable PAM support when
	  available.

	* configure.ac, services/plugins/*/Makefile.am, tests/*/Makefile.am: avoid
	  the "-rpath" hack to create plugins, using plugin_LTLIBRARIES instead (and
	  manually fixing things when necessary). Thanks to Dominique Leuenberger for
	  the suggestion (and sample patch).

	* docs/api/Makefile.am: fix doc target directories.

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/deployPkg/*, lib/include/deployPkg.h:
	  remove the deployPkg code, which depends on some VMware code that is not
	  yet open source.

	* lib/backdoor/*, lib/hgfs/*, lib/hgfsBd/*, lib/include/*,
	  lib/include/compat/*, lib/message/*, lib/misc/dbllnklst.c,
	  lib/rpcOut/rpcout.c: as part of sharing code between user-level code and
	  kernel modules, some files have been tagged with more than one license.

	* lib/dndGuest/*, lib/include/dndBase.h, lib/include/dndMsg.h,
	  lib/include/unity*, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: implement mouse movement
	  from within the guest; this avoids a dependency on "unofficial" mouse APIs
	  in the VMware host code, making DnD more reliable, and makes a few things
	  (such as cancelling an ongoing DnD operation) easier.

	* lib/file/filePosix.c: make File_FullPath()'s behavior consistent when the
	  input path starts with a '/'.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegration.c: send more info about the "start menu"
	  contents to the host (only usable for Windows guests).

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: prettify the category names of menu
	  items. This is a temporary solution before actually reading this
	  information from .desktop files.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c, lib/include/guestApp.h,
	  toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c, vmware-user/foreignVM*, vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp,
	  configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/include/socketMgr.h, lib/socketMgr.*:
	  remove code related to "foreign VM" support, which was never really used.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c:
	  properly report disk info for LVM volumes.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsDirNotify*, lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c: add support
	  for directory / file monitoring. It's currently only implemented on
	  Mac OS X.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer*: fix issue where it was possible to
	  create a file on a read-only share on Windows hosts.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer*, lib/hgfsServerManagerGuest/*,
	  lib/include/hgfs*.h, services/plugins/hgfsServer/hgfsPlugin.c,
	  services/plugins/vix/foundryToolsDaemon.c: some refactoring caused by the
	  work to make HGFS support pluggable transports.

	* lib/include/procMgr.h, lib/procMgr/procMgrPosix.c:
	  remove ProcMgr_GetAsyncStatus().

	* lib/include/vmsupport.h, scripts/vm-support, xferlogs/xferlogs.c,
	  services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: new feature to automatically
	  collect support data from the guest from the VMware UI.

	* lib/panicDefault/*, lib/user/*: change file names to avoid clash with
	  another file (Mac OS linker doesn't really like that).

	* lib/rpcChannel/rpcChannel.c: try to reinitialize the outbound channel on
	  failure.

	* lib/vixTools/vixTools.c, lib/include/vixCommands.h,
	  lib/include/vixOpenSource.h: add backend for new VIX API call to list the
	  guest's filesystems.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: lazily open the log file, instead of opening it
	  during configuration of the log system. This way two processes can use the
	  same conf file and not overwrite each other's log files (assuming the conf
	  data is sane).

	* modules/Makefile.am, modules/linux/vmci/Makefile.kernel,
	  modules/linux/vsock/Makefile.kernel: don't store VMCI module symbols in
	  /tmp during build; this avoids a possible symlink attack that could cause
	  data to be overwritten when building open-vm-tools.

	* modules/*/*, vmblock-fuse/*: remove a lot of duplicated files by either
	  moving them to a shared location or reusing files that were already
	  available elsewhere.

	* modules/freebsd/vmblock/subr.c, modules/freebsd/vmblock/vmblock_k.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmblock/vnoops.c: fix a possible kernel crash caused by
	  trying to read / write to the mount point (something vmware-user does to
	  detect whether it's using fuse or non-fuse vmblock).

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/*: adds support for a generic msg framework that is
	  currently used to deliver hot-plug/unplug notifications; get rid of a few
	  divisions; fix a bug where pvscsi_probe could return 0 (aka success) if
	  a call to kmalloc() failed; remove a few unused fields.

	* modules/linux/shared/vmci*: mostly changes related to the host VMCI drivers
	  (removed user-level queue-pair daemon, added support for trusted VMCI
	  endpoints) to keep binary compatibility between the host and guest VMCI
	  drivers.

	* modules/linux/hgfs/inode.c: check host's access rights when checking file
	  permissions, so that permissions are correctly checked when the guest's
	  user id is different from the host's user id.

	* modules/linux/bdhandler.*, modules/linux/filesystem.c; modules/linux/tcp.*,
	  modules/linux/transport.*,: postpone opening the channels so that module
	  can load successfully even if shared folders are disabled on the host;
	  fix a synchronization problem between recv and close/open; allow
	  hibernation to work by timing out the recv thread; correctly handle
	  failures in recv, including injecting a dummy error to the pending
	  requests when the recv thread exits; move the recv code to the channel's
	  implementation so that it can be simpler.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c, modules/linux/shared/compat_pci.h: fix
	  Wake-On-LAN for 2.6.27 and newer Linux guests.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/*: changes to support trusted VMCI host apps;
	  pull out notification and stats logging code into their own files.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/vnode.c: do not substitute errors returned by
	  uiomove() calls with EIO, propagate returned error code (which is EFAULT)
	  up the stack.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am, scripts/common/linux/pam.d/vmtoolsd-x64,
	  scripts/common/linux/pam.d/64/vmtoolsd: install the 64-bit PAM config
	  file with the correct name.

	* services/plugins/powerOps/powerOps.c: fix running default scripts by
	  making sure the path to the script is absolute.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am, services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: use info
	  from the configure step to define the plugin path; this avoids requiring
	  a symlink to be placed in /etc/vmware-tools for vmtoolsd to be able to
	  find the plugins.

	* services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: send the build information to the host so
	  it's logged in the VM's logs.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c, toolbox/toolboxcmd-*, toolbox/toolboxCmdInt.h:
	  make string comparison case-insensitive on Win32.

	* toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c: properly finish the shrinking process by
	  sending the "disk.shrink" RPC to the host.

	* toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix showing default settings for power ops
	  scripts (should show default script enabled, not script disabled).

	* vmblock-fuse/Makefile.am: fix compilation on FreeBSD.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.cpp: disallow copy-paste text of size greater than
	  4MB, instead of truncating the data.

	* vmware-user/dndUI.*, lib/dndGuest/dnd.cc, lib/include/dndBase.h: remove
	  drag timeout callback (which was not needed), and add new signal to
	  indicate that a GH DnD was cancelled.

	* vmware-user/Makefile.am: remove C++ link hack (not needed now since
	  vmware-user has C++ code already).

2009-04-23	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.04.17)

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, docs/*: build API docs for vmtools; the
	  documentation files are provided under a BSD-style license.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, guestd/*, lib/Makefile.am, lib/guestInfo/*,
	  lib/include/vmbackup_def.h, lib/include/vmBackup.h, lib/vmBackupLib/*,
	  libvmtools/Makefile.am, services/plugins/vmbackup/vmbackup_def.h: remove
	  guestd from open-vm-tools, and clean up code in other places that was only
	  there because of guestd.

	* configure.ac, modules/solaris/vmblock/*, modules/solaris/vmmemctl/*: add
	  Solaris vmblock and vmmemctl driver sources. The vmmemctl module also
	  includes a user-level daemon (vmmemctld.c).

	* lib/conf/conf.c, lib/include/conf.h, libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: remove
	  unused config options.

	* lib/deployPkg/toolsDeployPkg.h: code refactoring.

	* lib/dnd/dndClipboard.c: if size of clipboard exceeds the maximum backdoor
	  packet size, only keep text data (dropping the RTF data).

	* lib/dnd/dndLinux.c, lib/include/dnd.h, lib/include/vmblock.h,
	  vmware-user/copyPaste.c, vmware-user/dnd.c, vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp,
	  vmware-user/vmwareuserint.h, vmware-user-suid-wrapper/main.c: detect
	  whether plain vmblock or vmblock-fuse is being used, allowing the same
	  executable to be used with either.

	* lib/dndGuest/*, vmware-user/copyPaseDnDWrapper.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}, vmware-user/dragDetWnd.{cpp,h}:
	  vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp: more DnD V3 protocol work.

	* lib/ghIntegration/*, lib/include/guestCaps.h, lib/include/unityCommon.h:
	  work related to mapping Outlook folders over HGFS and exposing the Windows
	  Recycle Bin to the host (doesn't really affect open-vm-tools).

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: restore the native environment when
	  launching external applications. This doesn't really affect open-vm-tools.

	* lib/guestRpc/*, vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h}: implement RTF and file
	  contents copy & paste.

	* lib/include/circList.h, lib/include/vm_basic_math.h,
	  lib/include/vm_device_version.h, modules/linux/*, modules/Makefile.am:
	  changes to share files between the user space code and the kernel code,
	  instead of duplicating the same source files in different places.

	* lib/include/rpcChannel.h, lib/rpcChannel/*, tests/testDebug/testDebug.c,
	  test/vmrpcdbg/debugChannel.c: some code cleanup, and fix crash when dealing
	  with multiple reset messages.

	* lib/include/system.h, lib/system/systemLinux.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: remove System_Daemon() (replaced with
	  Hostinfo_Daemonize()).

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h, lib/unity/*: ressurrect UNITY_RPC_WINDOW_SHOW
	  and UNITY_RPC_WINDOW_HIDE RPCs.

	* lib/procMgr/procMgrPosix.c: fix ProcMgr_IsProcessRunning().

	* lib/system/systemLinux.c: fix shutdown / reboot commands on Solaris; fix
	  rebuilding of native environment from variables set by VMware scripts (this
	  last one doesn't really affect open-vm-tools).

	* lib/unicode/unicodeSimpleTypes.c: speed up UnicodeIANALookup, and fix case
	  where C++ constructors could call UnicodeIANALookup before Unicode_Init()
	  was called by lazily creating the internal cache.

	* libguestlib/*: link libguestlib against libvmtools. This avoids having
	  two definitions of certain symbols (like Debug()) when an application
	  links to both libraries.

	* modules/linux/vmblock/linux/control.c: only set directory entry owner when
	  needed.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/bdhandler.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/dir.c,

	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/tcp.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/transport.{c,h}:
	  cleanup use of atomic variables in HGFS; add a transport abstraction layer,
	  and add an initial version of a socket-based transport (not yet stable and
	  not yet supported by any released VMware product).

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: fix build on kernel 2.6.29.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_vsock.c: export more functions to other kernel
	  modules; some changes to statistics gathering code.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/filesystem.c: make module loadable on Solaris 9.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/vnode.c: unify mapping of HGFS to Solaris error
	  codes.

	* services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: better error logging.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: fix help string.

	* vmblock-fuse/block.c: fix vmblock-fuse compilation on FreeBSD.

2009-03-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.03.13)

	* configure.ac: check for FreeBSD kernel tree when building modules; warn
	  about which version of make to use when building kernel modules on FreeBSD
	  and Solaris; add compiler defines for identifying Solaris 9 and 11.

	* configure.ac, modules/Makefile.am: handle SYSDIR on FreeBSD.

	* guestd/main.c, modules/solaris/vmhgfs/Makefile: remove HGFS-related that
	  is now obsolete with the recent changes to the HGFS module on Solaris.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c: default to the configuration dir when the power
	  script path is not absolute.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, lib/include/guestInfo.h, lib/netUtil/netUtilLinux.c:
	  handle case when all network interfaces have been disabled and send an
	  "unknown" IP address to the host.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: always send
	  TOOLS_VERSION_UNMANAGED from an open-vm-tools build, so there's no need for
	  a config file option anymore.

	* hgfsclient/*: make it link to libvmtools to avoid code duplication.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtil.c: update list of "skippable" apps when figuring out
	  an application's path.

	* lib/auth/authPosix.c, scripts/linux/pam.d/*, guestd/Makefile.am,
	  services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am : change the name of the PAM application to
	  "vmtoolsd" to reflect the new service name.

	* lib/dnd/dndFileContentsUtil.h, lib/dnd/dndInt.h, lib/dndGuest/*.hh, and
	  corresponding files in lib/include: relocate private headers.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegration.c, lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationInt.h,
	  lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c, lib/include/unityCommon.h: glue code
	  for Outlook mirrored folder, which does not affect open-vm-tools.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/include/vmGuestLib.h,
	  libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c: add new guestlib counters.

	* lib/include/conf.h, toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: remove the need for the
	  "helpdir" config option; this doesn't really affect open-vm-tools since the
	  help files are not yet included.

	* lib/include/guest_os.h, lib/misc/hostinfoPosix.c: more guest OS names; fix
	  name used to identify Solaris to match what VMware's host code expects.

	* lib/include/guestStats.h: documentation changes.

	* lib/include/hostinfo.h, lib/user/hostinfoPosix.c: add a new function that
	  behaves like daemon(3), but is more Mac OS-friendly.

	* lib/include/toolsLogger.h, lib/Makefile.am, lib/toolsLogger/*: removed
	  library, which is not used anymore.

	* lib/include/vm_basic_types.h, lib/misc/timeutil.c: fixes to compile under
	  (Open) Solaris 11.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, services/plugins/vmbackup/stateMachine.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/serviceObj.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: add new
	  signal handler to gather debugging information from a running vmtoolsd
	  instance.

	* lib/misc/posixPosix.c: fix off-by-one error.

	* lib/unity/unity.c, lib/unity/unityPlatform.h, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c,
	  lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c: always send Unity updates using RPCI;
	  this avoids a possible race between replying to an incoming RPC and sending
	  an Unity update from a different thread; also, API documentation updates.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: verify the DnD detection window was
	  initialized before actually using it.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c:
	  reset _NET_WM_DESKTOP as necessary before exiting Unity; this could cause
	  guest taskbars to disappear when in Unity mode.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unity/unityX11.h: examine WM_CLIENT_LEADER when gathering application
	  information; certain applications use this property to define the window
	  where the WM_COMMAND property should be.

	* lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: do not follow symlinks when deleting files in the
	  guest using the VIX API.

	* libvmtools/vmtools.c, libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: allow the logging subsystem
	  to be re-configured, and clean up the logging data when unloading the
	  library; allow ${USER} and ${PID} to be used in log file paths.

	* modules/freebsd/vmblock/subr.c, modules/freebsd/vmblock/vnops.c: fix kernel
	  panic on FreeBSD 7.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile: remove GCC version check.

	* modules/linux/*/compat_wait.h: fix COMPAT_DEFINE_WAIT for "vanilla" 2.4
	  kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/Makefile.normal: fix build of HGFS module on 2.4
	  kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/*, modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: avoid using compat
	  functions when they're not needed; add compatibility functions for
	  newer Linux kernels.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.c: fix two races; one when the socket
	  state changed between calls to VSockVmciRecvStreamCB and
	  VSockVmciRecvPktWork, and another when trying to read from the socket after
	  a RST arrived after the socket got a detach notification.

	* modules/solaris/vmxnet3/*: add Solaris vmxnet3 driver.

	* rpctool/*: add "rpctool", a simple, stand-alone tool to send RPC commands
	  to the host software.

	* services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: don't cache configuration
	  data.

	* services/plugins/guestInfo/perfMonLinux.c: fix problem with overwriting
	  flags after GuestInfoMonitorReadMeminfo() was called. (Same as fix to
	  lib/guestInfo on previous release.)

	* services/plugins/powerOps/powerOps.c: handle power ops-related options
	  sent from the host.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c: handle re-loading the configuration file.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: exec after forking on Mac OS, since
	  CoreFoundation classes don't work after a fork.

	* services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: allow both 32 and 64 bit plugins to be
	  installed on Solaris by loading them from the appropriate directory;
	  add library loading code that is not really needed (nor used) in
	  open-vm-tools.

	* services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: send another "capability" the host expects
	  from Tools.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: add F1 shortcut to invoke help.

	* toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix issue with freeing data that should not be
	  freed.

	* vmware-user/*: implement the new DnD protocol (V3).


2009-02-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.02.13)

	* configure.ac, m4/vmtools.m4: clean up a lot of the library detection code.

	* configure.ac: remove support for gtk+ 1.2 (code already depended on it in
	  any case); enforce need for glib 2.6.0 or later due to new code being
	  added; add detection for gtkmm; check for C++ compiler when it's needed;
	  reorder the include path to avoid clashing with system headers in some
	  situations.

	* guestd/foundryToolsDaemon.*, vmware-user/foundryToolsDaemon.*,
	  guestd/Makefile.am, vmware-user/Makefile.am: moved shared source files to
	  a new place to avoid duplication.

	* hgfsmounter/hgfsmounter.c: add support for Solaris.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c: fix loading of icons when the name has a period.

	  lib/include/dndInt.h, lib/include/dndMsg.h, lib/include/dndRpc.hh,
	  lib/include/dndRpcV3.hh, lib/include/dndTransportGuestRpc.hh,
	  lib/include/dndTransport.hh, lib/include/libExport.hh,
	  vmware-user/copyPaste.cpp, vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/copyPasteV3.h, vmware-user/copyPasteWrapper.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/dnd.cpp, vmware-user/Makefile.am,
	  vmware-user/vmware-user.{c,cpp}, vmware-user/vmwareuserInt.h,
	  vmware-user/stringxx/string.{cc,hh}, vmware-user/stringxx/ubstr_t.hh: add
	  support for new version of the DnD protocol.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPerfMonLinux.c: fix problem with overwriting flags
	  after GuestInfoMonitorReadMeminfo() was called.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/include/vmGuestLib.h,
	  libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c: add new host stats.

	* lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am: fix a few compatibility issues with non-GNU
	  versions of make.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c, lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerInt.h,
	  lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c, */hgfsProto.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnops.c, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnopscommon.{c,h}:
	  don't trust the local VFS layer, check the HGFS server to see if an
	  operation would succeed.

	* lib/include/rpcChannel.h, lib/rpcChannel/*: add new Guest RPC channel
	  abstraction library used by the new "core services" code.

	* lib/include/vmrpcdbg.h, tests/*: add test code from the "core services"
	  project.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, lib/include/vmtoolsd_version.h,
	  services/vmtoolsd/*: add "vmtoolsd", the new service "shell" used in the
	  "core services" project.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c: don't send initial "region" updates for
	  shaped windows. This works around an issue where resizing a shaped window
	  would not work as expected in Unity mode.

	* lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c: fix major number detection for disks on newer Linux
	  kernels.

	* libvmtools/Makefile.am: link more libraries needed by vmtoolsd and the new
	  plugins.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c, modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi_version.h: use
	  PCI-specific memory allocation functions and update driver version.

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c: disable queue pair support in the host
	  version of the driver on older Linux kernels. This doesn't affect the
	  guest driver.

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmci_queue_pair.h: implement MSG_PEEK support on
	  Linux driver.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/bdhandler.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_sched.h,
	  modules/linux/vmmemctl/os.c: fix issue with HGFS module interfering with
	  suspend / hibernation on newer Linux kernels (bug #2523263).

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_cred.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/file.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/filesystem.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c: changes
	  for compatibility with newer Linux kernels, where it's not possible to
	  change fsuid/capabilities directly anymore.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_pagemap.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c:
	  fix warning, and compatibility changes for newer Linux kernels
	  (2.6.28.1 and newer; bug #2530616).

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c: fix creation of symlinks (bug #2531303).

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c: use PCI-specific memory allocation
	  functions.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: add option
	  to disable LRO.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_inet.{c,h}, modules/linux/vsock/util.{c,h}: add
	  MSG_PEEK support; remove ifdefs that were disabling support for queue
	  pairs on the host kernel module; fix compilation with certain versions
	  of gcc (bug #2531283).

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/*: move backdoor handling code to the HGFS driver;
	  this makes the user-level code to handle the driver (currently in
	  vmware-guestd) obsolete.

	* modules/solaris/vmxnet/*: add vmxnet driver for Solaris, under the CDDL.

	* services/plugins/*: add all currently available "core services" plugins.
	  The current set of plugins provide the functionality available in
	  vmware-guestd; there are a few plugins that replace functionality from
	  vmware-user, but not all features are ported yet (and vmtoolsd - with
	  vmware-user plugins - and vmware-user cannot run at the same time).

	* toolbox/toolboxAbout.c: fix the copyright character.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: reword a few messages, fix typos.

	* toolbox/toolboxCmdInt.h, toolbox/toolboxcmd-record.c,
	  toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c, toolbox/toolboxRecord.c: remove the "record"
	  functionality from tools (due to internal request).

	* toolbox/toolboxInt.c, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c, toolbox/toolbox-scripts.c:
	  changes to use the new config file format used by the "core services" code.

	* */Makefile.am: make sure 'rm' and 'mv' are being used instead of $(RM) and
	  $(MV) (which are not defined by automake; bug #2492040).

2009-01-21	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.01.19)

	* configure.ac: detect the presence of FUSE libraries.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: compile kernel modules for Solaris, and
	  vmblock-fuse module if FUSE is available.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: retrieved localized application
	  names.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c,
	  lib/include/hostinfo.h, lib/misc/hostinfo_misc.c, lib/misc/hostinfoPosic.c,
	  lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: refactoring to move code shared with other VMware
	  products to a common library.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am,
	  lib/include/vmGuestLib.h, libguestlib/*: add new iteration of the
	  "guestlib" protocol. This is a more extensible solution than the current
	  protocol, and should make it easier to add new information when needed.

	* lib/include/dynarray.h, lib/include/dynbuf.h, lib/misc/dynarray.c,
	  lib/misc/dynbuf.c: make some DynArray/DynBuf functions inline for speed.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h: more documentation about the Unity protocol.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: fix Unity<->guest desktop ID mappings.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: change the way log domains are configured; now
	  sub-domains inherit the default handler for the app if no handler is
	  specified.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.c, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnopscommon.{c,h}: implement support for mmap on
	  the Mac OS driver, which allows running executables from an HGFS
	  share. The FreeBSD module still does not support this functionality.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/transport.{c,h}: refactoring for sharing structure
	  definitions.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c, modules/linux/vmblock/linux/module.c,
	  modules/linux/vmci/vmci_drv.c, modules/linux/hgfs/module.c,
	  modules/linux/vmmemctl/os.c, modules/linux/vmsync/sync.c,
	  modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: add support
	  for Novell's proprietary module info tag ("supported").

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c: add support for VMCI queue pairs on
	  the host. This does not affect the driver when it runs inside virtual
	  machines.

	* modules/linux/vmci/*.h, modules/linux/vsock/*.h: some changes in the common
	  code to support Mac OS X, and also queue pairs on the Solaris VMCI module.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_vsock.{c,h}: add functions for registering with
	  the vsock driver from within the kernel.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile: add $(LINUXINCLUDE) to the compiler flags; this
	  allows compiling the modules against recent kernels which removed that
	  from $(KBUILD_CPPFLAGS).

	* modules/Makefile.am: add support for compiling Solaris kernel modules.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/*: initial release of the Solaris HGFS driver in
	  open-vm-tools. Driver is licensed under the CDDL 1.0.

	* vmblock-fuse/*: add the user-level implementation of the vmblock driver,
	  which is build on top of FUSE, to open-vm-tools. vmware-user hasn't yet
	  been modified to use this version of vmblock.

	* vmware-user/copyPaseV3.h: new header introduced during development of the
	  next version of copy paste / DnD for X11 platforms.


2008-11-23  Marcelo Vanzin  <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2008.12.19)

	* configure.ac, */Makefile.am: standardize on using libtool archives for
	  the libraries. This also means several makefiles were removed, since
	  there's no need to build two archives of the same library anymore.

	* configure.ac: add logic to detect glib 2.6; this is the minimum version
	  required by the "Core Services" project. Currently it's an optional
	  dependency.

	* configure.ac: disable Unity when user specifies --disable-multimon.

	* configure.ac: actually build the pvscsi modules if the detected kernel
	  version supports it.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, lib/guestInfo/Makefile.am,
	  lib/stubs/Makefile.am, libvmtools/*, lib/include/vmtools.h: add the
	  "vmtools" shared library used in the "Core Services" project. The library
	  is a collection of a lot of other libraries used by most VMware Tools
	  programs, and adds some functionality on top of glib that is used in the
	  "Core Services" project. Currently no other components from that project
	  are available as part of open-vm-tools.

	* lib/deployPkg/deployPkgLog.h, lib/deployPkg/toolsDeployPkg.h: moved private
	  headers out of the public header directory.

	* lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am, modules/Makefile.am: fix the makefiles so that
	  it's possible to build open-vm-tools from a directory different from the
	  source dir.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c: changes to support aliases on Mac OS hosts.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c: changes to map Windows attributes to
	  Mac OS FileInfo.

	* lib/include/circList.h: removed unused file.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h, lib/unity/unity.c: changes to add documentation
	  to various application RPCs used in Tools.

	* lib/misc/posixPosix.c, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix include path for
	  syslimits.h on FreeBSD.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: better detection of the guest's work area
	  boundaries; fixes a problem when dragging a Window in Unity mode with
	  the host's task bar on the left/right of screen would result in weird
	  behavior.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unity/unityX11.h: preserve the _NET_WM_DESKTOP setting when hiding
	  windows; this fixes a problem where hiding a panel and later restoring it
	  would result in the wrong _NET_WM_DESKTOP property being set for the panel,
	  causing it to only display on the first virtual desktop.

	* modules/linux/vmci/*: minor changes related to internal development of the
	  Mac OS drivers.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c: fix HGFS driver for kernel 2.6.28.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.c: added code to gather some performance
	  statistics for the driver.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: a few fixes to the help functionality.

	* vmware-user/vmware-user.c, vmware-user-suid-wrapper/main.c: change the
	  "blockFd" argument to have an extra dash so it follows the convention of
	  common command line parsing libraries.

	* Other bug fixes and changes in shared code that don't affect open-vm-tools.

	  needed for dependent modules to load if a kernel >= 2.6.26 is compiled
	  with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS. Make the vsock module reference the vmci module's
	  symbols.

	* modules/vmmemctl/freebsd/os.c: add sysctl to get driver status. Information
	  can be retrieved with "sysctl vm.vmmemctl".

   * modules/linux/vmci/vmci_defs.h, modules/linux/vmci/vmci_call_defs.h,
     modules/linux/vsock/vmciHostKernelAPI.h: changes related to VMCI work
     on VMware ESX.

	  improving the poll behavior and sending less packets when waiting
	  for a response.

   * modules/linux/vmsnc/sync.c: fix panic on kernels < 2.6.20.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_int.h,
     modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_version.h: inherit net device features to
     avoid having the kernel setting the PSH flag on every TCP packet (among
     other issues).

	  instance from a signal callback.

	* vmware-user/copyPaste.c: work around an issue when OpenOffice's "cut"
