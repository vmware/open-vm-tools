    Avoid a vmtoolsd service error message if not on a VMware hypervisor.
    
    When open-vm-tools comes preinstalled in a base Linux release, the
    vmtoolsd services are started automatically at system start
    and desktop login.  If running on physical hardware or in a non-VMware
    hypervisor, the services will emit an error message to the systemd's
    logging service before stopping.
    
    This change removes the unwanted error message.

commit bb64ec6aa24c123bb25d1c48a4c126efa4fda5bf
Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 12:01:14 2022 -0800

    Add an example of a new deployPkg/wait-cloudinit-timeout setting to tools.conf.

commit cd995a58b07a91d7804d9fdec5545a5fe11e9db9
Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 12:01:14 2022 -0800

    Make Linux perl based customization work with the cloud-init workflow.
    
    To resolve issues seen where users want to set a vm's networking
    and apply cloud-init userdata together before the vm is booted, the
    deployPkg plugin has been modified to wait for cloud-init
    execution to finish.  This allows cloud-init to finish execution
    completely before the customization process triggers a reboot
    of the guest.
    
    This change is solely in the deployPkg plugin side, so a user can get
    this change by upgrading their open-vm-tools in the guest/template.
    Crossport of change 10318445 and 10330918 from main to vmtools-prod-cpd.

commit f7009c53afdab9a9507257c77bfeb30d8baaac8c
Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 12:01:14 2022 -0800

    Add a null undo function to the vmbackup null provider.
    
    If a snapshot operation times out, vmbackup can attempt
    to undo quiescing.  Since no quiescing is done for the null
    backup provider, no undo function was provided.  If vmbackup
    attempts to call the undo function, it dereferences a garbage
    pointer resulting in a segfault.
    
    Rather than add null backup provider specific checks to vmbackup,
    this change adds a null undo function to provide vmbackup with a
    valid function pointer it can call.  The new undo function updates
    the vmbackup state machine state with a new currentOpName, but
    has no other effect.  currentOpName is set to the calling
    function name, e.g. __FUNCTION__.

    The "gint64" type used for time values in the code is not a "long" on
    i386.  The fix using the glib "G_GINT64_FORMAT" macro was provided by
    the Debian OVT maintainer.

    Improve the "don't touch this" comments for Linux guest identification.
    
    Pull requests to add distro identification information are often submitted.
    Open-vm-tools does not own the guest identification code.  Such a change
    requires coordinated changes throughout the VMware product stack.
    
    Improve the text to reduce pull requests for changes to common source
    code that open-vm-tools does not own and cannot make.

    Generalize VMX RPC code in vgauthservice.
     - Rework the code so that it can used for other RPCs in the future.
     - Rework the code reading the RPC reply, since it can now be much larger.
     - Also remove the attempt to use the "guest.log.text" RPC since the VMX
       will just drop the logging on the floor with no error if the virtual
       HW version is too old.  A smart fail over is not possible.

    Adding configuration information for the GlobalConf feature.
    
    As part of the GlobalConf feature, a "globalconf" section is introduced
    into tools.conf to provide custom configuration options for the feature.
    The configuration parameters are as follows:
     * enabled=false - Enable/disable the GlobalConf module.
     * poll-interval=3600 - Poll interval for the GlobalConf feature.
     * resource=<path> - Defines the location of the tools.conf in the
                         GuestStore.  There is a separate default for Windows
                         and Linux guests.

    asyncsocket.c: Use size_t in place of int type for array size and indexing.
    
    Glibc 2.35 with GCC 11 and 12 produces additional warnings about strings
    and array bounds.  Switching from "int" to "size_t" type for variable
    used for the array size and element indexing.
    
    GCC warned when an integer value is passed as the size of the
    struct pollfd array to poll().

    AppVisibility: Skip terminated/stopped containers.
    
    Added code to skip terminated/stopped containers.  This is done
    by using TaskStub to retrieve the pid for the running container.
    If the pid cannot be retrieved, then that container is skipped.
    
    The previously suppressed "default" namespace has been restored.
    
    Fixed another minor issue with calculating the number of containers
    that were added.
    
    Note: This changeset introduces a dependency on Tasks.proto, and
    Tasks.proto depends on a few other proto files like mount, metrics,
    descriptor and task.  Modified the makefile to generate the necessary
    C++ files from the proto files.
    
    Additional notes:
     - .proto -> generates .pb.h, .pb.c and .grpc.pb.cc files.
     - For compiling and building the library (.so file), the .grpc.pb.{h,cc}
       and .pb.{h,cc} files are needed.
     - The protoc compiler generates .pb.h and .pb.c files when the --cpp_out
       option is specified.
     - The protoc compiler generates .grpc.pb.* when the --grpc_out option is
       specified.

    Update open-vm-tools to build with either Fuse 3 or Fuse 2
    
    Vendors are requesting that open-vm-tools can be built with either
    Fuse 2 or Fuse 3.  While both Fuse 2 and Fuse 3 runtime can be
    installed on a Linux system, vendors would prefer to switch from
    Fuse 2 to Fuse 3 at the same time for all products to be available
    with the base OS.
    
    Updating the configure.ac file to check for the presence of the Fuse 3
    or Fuse 2 development packages in the build environment.  Providing
    configure options to allow users to control the version of Fuse to be
    used.
     --without-fuse       - vmblock-fuse and vmhgfs-fuse will be disabled.
     --with-fuse=fuse3|3  - use Fuse 3.x
     --with-fuse=fuse|2   - use Fuse 2.x
     --with-fuse=auto     - check for Fuse 3 or Fuse 2 availability; disable
                            vmblock-fuse and vmhgfs-fuse if unavailable.
     --with-fuse          - implicit "yes".
     --with-fuse=yes      - check for Fuse 3 or Fuse 2 availability; disable
                            vmblock-fuse and vmhgfs-fuse if unavailable.
    
    Pull request: https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/pull/544
    Fixes issue:  https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/314
    
    The vmblock-fuse code is also used by WorkStation.  Configure defines
    are not available in internal builds.  Reworked preprocessor tests to
    use FUSE_MAJOR_VERSION from the fuse headers to determine API to be
    used during compilation.

    containerInfo Plugin: list the Docker and Kubernetes containers in a guest VM.
    
    Added code for a new open-vm-tools plugin, containerInfo.
    - Added a new configure option --disable-containerinfo to disable building
      the containerinfo plugin.
       --disable-containerinfo : Will not check for any dependent packages and
                                 will not build the containerinfo plugin.
       --enable-containerinfo=no : Same as --disable-containerinfo
       --enable-containerinfo=auto : Checks for the dependent packages. If they
                                     are available, then the containerinfo plugin
                                     will be built. Otherwise, a warning is printeds
                                     and the containerinfo plugin will be skipped.
       --enable-containerinfo
       --enable-containerinfo=yes  : Checks for the dependent packages. If they are
                                     available, then the containerinfo plugin will
                                     be built.  Otherwise, the configure will
                                     terminate with an error.
    
    - Updated the sample tools.conf file with various settings related to
      the containerinfo plugin.
    - Due to an issue reported in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9184,
      implemented a workaround by changing 'import weak ' to 'import ' in the
      .proto files while generating the header files.
    
    Build dependencies: (packages names may vary with Linux release).

    Customization: Retry the Linux reboot if telinit is a soft link to systemctl.
    
    Issues have been reported on some newer versions of Linux where the VM
    failed to reboot at the end of a traditional customization.  The command
    '/sbin/telinit 6' exited abnormally due to SIGTERM sent by systemd and
    where telinit is a symlink to systemctl.
    
    This fix checks if telinit is a soft link to systemctl and if yes, retries
    a system reboot until the telinit command succeeds or the reboot literally
    happens.

    Remove unwanted "volatile" from static variable used with g_once_init_enter()
    
    The glib api documentation for g_once_init_enter() specifically states
    that "volatile" should NOT be used with the address passed as the
    argument.  Recent compilers (GCC-11 & clang 11) and recent versions of
    glib-2 will result in a warning that the "volatile" qualifier has been
    dropped if it has been used.
    
    Remove the unneeded and unwanted "volatile" qualifier from the definition
    of "inited" in pollGtk.c.

    Common source file change not directly applicable to open-vm-tools.
    
    Introduce peek() to the asyncsocket API, only supported by TCP vtable.
    
    Peeks are similar to recv(), except that they do not drain the socket
    after reading.  Subsequent peek/recv reads the same data back.  However
    since recv does SSL_Read, a recv() following a peek() may not get the same
    data as peek() after SSL is initialized.  This is not a problem when
    peeks are done before SSL setup.
    
    Implementation notes:
    
    - peek is a one-shot operation. The poll callback is unregistered
      once it fires (recv keeps the callback until recv is cancelled).
    - non-partial peek is not supported, so the peek callback will be fired when
      any amount of data less than or equal amount of the requested length is
      available in the socket buffer.
    - It is possible to invoke recv() or peek() recursively from within the peek()
      callback.  A peek is disallowed from within the recv() callback.

    Fix an ASSERT in bora/lib/misc/timeutil.c.
    
    Fix a problem with TimeUtil_NtTimeToUnixTime on Arm that was encountered
    when running tools tests on Apple silicon.  The problem was the routine
    assumed that a variable was 32-bits if VM_X86_64 was not defined.  This
    may have been true in the past, but it is no longer true now that the code
    is also built for 64-bit Arm.

    VGAuth: Use GUESTRPCPKT_FIELD_FAST_CLOSE flag for log messages.
    
    VGauth is a single action service.  With the GUESTRPCPKT_FIELD_FAST_CLOSE
    flag added, VMX closes the vsocket as soon as the RPC response is sent.
    This cleans up the vsocket connections faster and minimizes the number
    of connect() failures in the guest.

    Asyncsocket: Add comments about AsyncSocket_SetErrorFn usage.
    
    Document that AsyncSocket_SetErrorFn must be called before an internal
    asyncsocket callback can fire and trigger a call to the error handler.
    The error handler must be set immediately after the asyncsocket is created,
    either from the poll thread, which requires no additional synchronization,
    or while holding the asyncsocket lock, which is passed via pollParams.

    Fix issues using GCC 11 with gtk >= 3.20 and glib >=2.66.3
    
    With glib2.0 releases >= 2.66.3, glib header files inside an
    extern "C" block will encounter compilation errors.  This has
    impacted several OSS packages.  Consumers of newer versions of glib2.0
    must not include glib headers in an extern "C" block.
    
    GTK 3.20 has deprecated gdk_display_get_device_manager(); using the
    newer gdk_display_get_default_seat() when the GTK version is >= 3.20.
    
    The return value from read() must be used to avoid an unused result
    warning from the compiler.  This can be avoided by using dummy retyping
    in the case where the return value is not used or in this case, using
    the returned value in a debug log message.

    JSMN: Miscellaneous log message fixes.
    
    * One log message in jsmn_parse_string function referred to a primitive
      instead of a string.
    
    * When the parsing fails, the log message specified the wrong position
      where the parsing failed.
    
    * Changed '%c' to '0x%02x' in the log messages to avoid any issues with
      printing the invalid/unprintable characters.
    
    * Added a new log message for better debugging in one specific error
      code path.

    Linux guest identification: Support multiple architectures.
    
    Allow machine architecture information to be present in the
    "short string" and the guestOS string.  This is done via a prefix,
    "<arch>-" (e.g. arm-ubuntu-64, riscv-debian11-64, arm-windows10-64)
    with the X86 architecture being implied (no explicit "<arch>-").
    
    Add the recognition of the Arm machine architecture to the Linux
    guest identification code.

    Implement log redirection for the deployPkg plugin.
    
    On Linux, /var/log/vmware-imc/toolsDeployPkg.log is the default deployPkgs
    log file.  This change allows users to redirect that log to the vmware.log
    on the host or to another file located on the guest VM.  Redirection is
    controlled by settings in the "logging" section of the tools.conf file.
    
    See the examples in the sample tools.conf file provided in the distribution.

    Configuring OVT with the --without-pam option will implicitly disable vgauth.
    
    When no vgauth option is given alongside -–without-pam, a warning
    is displayed with a message “Building without PAM; vgauth will be
    disabled.”.
    
    When -–disable-vgauth is supplied alongside –-without-pam, no
    warning or error message is displayed.
    
    When -–enable-vgauth is supplied alongside -–without-pam, an
    error will be thrown and the configure stage will be aborted with an
    error message “Cannot enable vgauth without PAM. Please configure
    without --without-pam or without --enable-vgauth.”

    tools/vmwgfxctrl: Add a command line tool for controlling vmwgfx.
    
    vmwgfxctrl is a small command line tool used to control various
    aspects of the vmwgfx kernel driver.  Currently it can both
    display and set current topology of the vmwgfx kernel driver.
    
    It should be distributed alongside other open-vm-tools binaries.
    It's incredibly useful when trying to set custom resolution on any
    recent distro (that includes multi-monitor setups).

    stringxx: Replace usage of deprecated glibmm function
    
    Glibmm::RefPtr::clear() has been deprecated for a while and was removed in
    2.51. The reasoning is listed in the 2.44 header:
    
    "/// @deprecated Use reset() instead because this leads to confusion with
    clear() methods on the underlying class."
    
    reset() has been available since 2.16, so it is trivial to switch to it.

    and "ss" commands when available.
    
    If Available:         Fallback:
         ip                   ifconfig
         ip route             route

    [open-vm-tools part] Support raw cloud-init data in VM customization.
    
    To support this feature, open-vm-tools needs to check whether cloud-init
    can support raw cloud-init data; then copy the data to the cloud-init
    cfg directory.

    resolution: Fix kms autodetection
    
    Currently, the elf binary of the xorg driver is loaded to check for a
    string that was put in the .modinfo section in the driver.  Unfortunately
    there are two problems with this approach:
    
      1) Distros now ship without xorg, so the xorg .so doesn't exist and
         there's nothing to check.
      2) Distros (e.g. Fedora) do heavy optimizations and remove the .modinfo
         section from the .so, so the string cannot be found even though the
         driver exists.
    
    To fix both, stop depending on being able to parse the elf binary of the
    xorg driver.  Instead, let the plugin check for the existence of the drm
    driver with a sufficiently high version, and if it exists, use kms.
    This removes the dependency on X for kms.  Also increase the version of
    vmwgfx required to ensure atomic mode-setting plus relevant bug fixes (in
    the kernel since 2017) are available.

    Add a switch to the vm-support script to transfer the support bundle to the hypervisor
    
    The vm-support script unconditionally transferred the support bundle to
    to the VMware hypervisor, thereby filling vmware.log.
    This fix changes the default behavior of the Linux and Windows scripts
    to *not* transfer the logs to the host.
    
    Added an option '-x' to both scripts to let the user elect to
    transfer the guest support bundle to the host.

    Add NVMe capability for vmbackup.
    
    The vmx/vmbackup logic checks if tools/vmbackup can support NVMe.  If it
    is supported, vmx/vmbackup can further go through the app quiesce process.
    Otherwise, vmx/vmbackup requests the filesystem quiesce process.

    Fix an issue where CustomizationUnknownFailure is generated multiple times
    on Linux.
    
    For Linux, sysimage sends a failure status to VMX when the deploy pkg
    failed.  The tools plugin then sends the failure notice again.  Changing the
    plugin to only send the failure notice for Windows guests where the
    failure has yet to be logged.

    Customization: Set log level to info, not error, for failed /sbin/telinit command
    
    The error message of a failed /sbin/telinit command is confusing for
    customers who might think customization failed.  On some Guest OSes,
    the repeatedly executing /sbin/telinit command can fail while a reboot
    is happening and the init daemon has been killed.
    This change sets log level to info, not error, for failed /sbin/telinit
    command.
    Note: The first /sbin/telinit commmand failure will fail customization
    with error 127; this is unchanged.

    [resolution/x11] Preserve the rotation
    
    The screen orientation/rotation was being reset on each mode set.
    In general that is not a bad behavior.   But it does break with a
    fit to window and such as it will continuously reset the user
    requested orientation.
    This patch preserves the orientation/rotation on mode changes.

    Log file name becomes invalid after a rotation
    
    This is because the accounting is done unsigned but the printf used (in
    multiple places) was "%d".  Fix this by using "%u".
    
    As documented in the function header, the wrap around case was not handled
    properly, so this was fixed as well.  If the maximum rotation number hits
    MAX_UINT32, all of the files are renamed to pack the files as if this was
    the beginning of a rotation sequence.

    OVT: Build only fuse-based or kernel module vmblocktest programs.
    
    The OVT configuration determines whether open-vm-tools will build
    a vmblock kernel module or a vmblock-fuse user level VMBlock
    implementation.  Both versions of the vmblocktest program(s) are not
    needed.   Linux OVT is only using the vmblock-fuse implementation.
    
    Select the version to build based on the HAVE_FUSE setting from the
    ./configure run.
    
    This fixes https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/467

    MXUser Semaphores - nanosecond resolution wait times
    
    The graphics team requested the ability to have semaphore wait times
    less than a millisecond.  This would greatly improve some graphics
    operations.  Since POSIX platforms (i.e. ESXi, MacOS, Linux) support
    nanosecond resolution for semaphore wait times, a new timed semaphore
    wait routine with nanosecond resolution is introduced.

    Fix propagation of libtirpc flags into build of test source.
    
    Starting with glibc 2.32, the Linux libc<n>-dev no longer provides
    the /usr/include/rpc/rpc.h header.  The configure script will detect
    the availability of the libtirpc package and use the rpc.h header
    from /usr/include/tirpc/rpc/rpc.h.
    
    This fix extends the necessary compilation and linking options to the
    build of the open-vm-tools services test programs that utilize RPC.

    Add a usage message for the "checkvm" utility.
    
    This change alters the functionality of the -h option to print a
    usage message by using glib options.  The previous functionality of -h
    was to print hardware version, which prints invalid results.  This
    change also removes a repeated header file and removes the -r option
    which prints invalid results.

    Change the default Unicode error errno.
    
    In times long past, EINVAL was chosen for the errno returned when a
    Unicode problem was detected.  This overloads EINVAL, particularly when
    using POSIX system calls.  Unfortunately, the overloading makes it very
    difficult to recover from some errors as there is no way to know the
    difference between a "real" EINVAL and a Unicode problem EINVAL.
    
    Over 10 years of data shows that we *RARELY* encounter Unicode errors.
    Inspecting the source base shows the code segments that do check for
    errno after an error either:
    
    1) Post the errno value and die.
    2) Have switch handle cases but also have a default catcher.
    3) Have an if/else waterfall with a final else.
    
    Another observation is that Unicode routines are not involved with
    anything that would return a math related errno (e.g. ERANGE, EDOM).
    
    Changing the value of UNICODE_CONVERSION_ERRNO to ERANGE and avoid
    any overloading.

    Fix memory leaks.
    
    A Coverity scan of open-vm-tools reported a number of memory leaks
    on error code paths.  Fix seven reported leaks, and modify code
    to address two false positives in order to make the code clearer
    and/or keep Coverity from reporting the issues.  Also fix additional
    leaks found in the routine Proto_TextContents during code review.

    Update vm_basic_types.h for apple silicon
    
    Apple silicon compilers will define __arm64__ as their
    name for their new CPU. But they also define __aarch64__ which
    existing 64-bit ARM CPUs use.  Add a little bit of logic
    to enforce and document this.

    [GlobalConf] Support for vmusr service to load Global Configuration.
    
    Currently, the vmsvc service periodically downloads the Global Configuration
    from the GuestStore and applies the downloaded configuration.  'vmusr'
    service doesn't have the support.  In this changeset, made the changes
    for both vmusr and vmsvc services to periodically check and apply
    the changes.
    
    To keep thing simple and easy, the new approach is check the
    modification time every time the regular tools conf is read and if
    changes are detected, the configuration is applied.  With this new approach,
    signalling mechanism is not needed and that code is removed.
    
    vmsvc:
    * Starts a background thread which periodically fetches the global
    configuration from the GuestStore.
    
    vmusr:
    * No background thread is created. But checks and loads the configuration
    everytime the regular tools.conf is checked.

    hostinfo.h: stop including x86cpuid.h
    
    With the removal of Hostinfo_GetAllCpuid in an earlier change, hostinfo.h
    can stop including x86cpuid.h and only needs vendor IDs from x86vendor.h.
    
    Unfortunately, quite a few source files depended in hostinfo.h's automatic
    inclusion of x86cpuid.h. Fix them to include what they need.
    
    The lib/include/guestStats.h is a special case that happened to succeed because
    of a warning that was disabled in x86cpuid.h which also happens to have
    been included earlier than this header.  Re-disable the warning.

    LOG: Keep the LOG_LEVEL entries sorted
    
    This is the first in a series of changes to the Log Facility that will add
    the ability to have domain specific filtering (e.g. foobar domain can have
    log calls which are filtered by domain (name) and level).  This will make
    LOG like abilities usable in all build types, even a release build.
    
    The LOG_LEVEL entries are difficult to find since they are in a jumbled
    order.  The existing grouping isn't useful as many of the modules are shared.
    Create one big sorted list.

    Expose a cmdfile argument which works like --cmd, but
    reads the input from a file.  This allows RPCs which can
    have huge arguments (guestVars, namespaceDB, DataSets) to work.

    An investigation found that while copying a group of small files from host
    to guest using the shared folder, the HGFS_OP_GETATTR_V3 message was handled
    in HGFS server 276,140 times over a period of ~35 seconds.
    
    Caching the file attributes in HGFS on the server-side can reduce the time
    significantly (from experimental results, 35s => 8s).
    
    It was also discovered that Posix_RealPath is called repeatedly to check
    whether a path is a symlink, since HgfsServerGetLocalNameInfo is called when
    handling a series of requests.
    
    Integrate a key-value cache to HGFS server to cache the symlink check results
    and file attributes, using the file path as the key.  This task will be divided
    into multiple change:
    
    1. Add oplock support
    2. Add a customized LRU cache in HGFS server for file attributes and
       symlink check results
    
    -  New files:
       hgfsCache.h/c: implements a customized LRU cache which is built by
                      combining two data structures: a doubly linked list and
                      a hash table.
    
    -  The cache will be allocated only when oplock is enabled.
    -  The cache relies on the file change monitor provided by oplock to ensure
       there is no stale data.  When adding an entry into the cache, also
       register the file change callback to oplock.  Upon receiving the file change
       callback, invalidate the cache.  Once the cache is full, remove the LRU
       entry and unregister the file change callback for it.

    [HGFS Server] Support oplock inside HGFS server for Windows host
    
    Missed two source files for previous HGFS Server changeset.

Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 7 12:03:24 2020 -0700

    [HGFS Server] Support oplock inside HGFS server for Windows host
    
    The motivation for this change is to cache file/directory related information
    in host side, for example the file/directory attributes.  To make the cache
    correct, we will use the oplock(Windows)/lease(Linux) to monitor the
    file/directory change event.  When the file/directory changes, the item in
    cache will be invalidated.
    
    In this change, two new functions are defined:
    - HgfsOplockMonitorFileChange
       This function is used to monitor the change event for a file/directory,
       and the callback will be called if file/directory is changed.
    - HgfsOplockUnmonitorFileChange
       This function is used to cancel the change event monitoring.
    
    This patch only implements the oplock support for Windows host, the support
    for Linux will be delivered in another patch.

    GOSC event doesn't report at once after customization process timer is reached
    
    When process timer is reached, the command process is killed and function
    ProcessRead is called to read all the output till EOF.  But EOF can't be
    reached immediately.  The reason is pre-customization script is launched
    by perl script, and killing perl script process doesn't kill the
    pre-customization script process.
    This code update includes:
    1. Do not read stdout/stderr when gosc command process exits abnormally
       to avoid the EOF blocking.
    2. Add READSTATUS_PENDING_TO_EOF in enum ReadStatus to avoid the confusion
       with READSTATUS_PENDING.
    3. Close the write ends of pipes (stdout[1]/stderr[1]) for child command
       process before it exists.
    4. In processPosix.c, the write ends of pipes have been closed in line 180,
       181, so the read ends should be closed in line 254, 255.
    5. Add explicit note for the beginning and the end of the perl script log.

    hostinfoPosix: remove NOT_IMPLEMENTED() when NO_IOPL
    
    When running "vmtoolsd -b pidfile" on Linux arm64, we hit this error:
    
       [error] [vmsvc] NOT_IMPLEMENTED hostinfoPosix.c:2526
    
    Linux arm64 does not implement iopl() and the Hostinfo_ResetProcessState()
    is raising a NOT_IMPLEMENTED() because of that.  However if there's no iopl(),
    there is no reason to drop IO privileges, so we can just skip that code.
    
    This change also restores usage of getloadavg() for non Android arm64
    platforms: ESX vmx and tools for Linux arm64.

    Code cleanup to address a Coverity issue.
    
    Coverity reports a "dereference after NULL check" in
    BkdoorChannelStart.  However, at the point of dereference
    it's known that chan->inStarted is TRUE, which means chan->in
    is guaranteed to be non-NULL, so it's not a bug.
    
    Still, given that an input channel, if present, must have been
    started before calling BkdoorChannelStart, it's possible to do
    some code cleanup that will also get Coverity to stop reporting
    the issue.  Change what's currently a test into an ASSERT, test
    chan->in rather than chan->inStarted, and add comments to make
    it clearer what's going on.

    Improve Linux guest identification function documentation.
    
    Make it clear that the "short name" of a Linux distro has a default
    value and that the default value should not be overwritten unless
    VMware does this.
    
    If someone cheats and sends down an unsupported "short name", the
    guestMapper will protect the software stack, mapping the unsupported
    "short name" to that of the guestOS config found in the VMX file.
    We know that is OK since the VM couldn't power on and run the guest
    unless it was valid.
    
    All older, supported ESXi have updates that contain the guestMapper.
    
    If the guestMapper is not in place - an older, unpatched release -
    the software stack can become confused causing problems and crashes.

    1. Environment variable 'ALIVE_BASE' is used to construct the path of

       when running the script inside serviceDiscovery plugin process, so a
       hardcoded path is used.
    
    2. Added command to retrieve tcserver version

    * GUESTLIB_HOST_MEM_KERN_OVHD_MB metric was already deprecated in ESXi
      starting from 7.1.  It's time to deprecate the corresponding
      VMGuestLib_GetHostMemKernOvhdMB API in GuestSDK.  The documentation
      will be update denoting that this API is deprecated.
      After one or two releases, the API will be removed completely.
      Untill then, the API is modified to explicity return 0 for the metric.
    
    * Only a few functions listed in vmGuestLib.h are exposed in the vmGuestLibJava
      interface.  The remaining functions are encapsulated in '#ifndef SWIG'
      to hide them from SWIG utility which is used to generate the Java bindings.
    
    Note: The external customer facing documentation for this API will be
          documented later.
    Note: Once this changeset is submitted, the vmStatsProvider module
          will be updated to stop using the deprecated API.

    GuestSDK and vmtoolslib cleanup.
    
    * Removed the vmtools dependency for guestsdk.  This has been already
      done for tar tools build/target.  The same is being done for OVT
      builds.
    
    * Used various static libraries for building guestlib in OVT instead of
      depending on vmtoolslib.  Similar thing has already been done for
      appmonitor library in OVT.
    
    * GuestSDK_{Panic|Debug|Warning|Log} functions in vmtoolslib are not used
      anywhere and hence they are completely removed from the code.

    If xmlsec and vgauth are built inconsistently, xmlSecSize
    can differ between the two, which results in a key datastructure
    being a different size, and vgauth ends up looking in the
    wrong place in memory for the signature check status.
    
    Log the status, so that if its not one of the two
    expected values, we have some ideas of what went wrong.

    lib/file: Fix a memory leak in FileLock_Lock.
    
    Valgrind complained about a minor leak within FileLock_Lock when running
    test-vmx Firmware.Efi.QuickBoot .  FileLockScanner builds a list of "active
    locks" and traverses that list repeatedly, but whenever it decides to remove
    an entry from the list, it would simply leak it.
    
    This change ensures that the list item is not leaked by Posix_Free()ing it
    once it is no longer needed.

    Hgfs Linux/OSX Server: fix write-only shares access check creating new files
    
    Linux and OS X Hgfs server has an incorrect failure status check when a
    user has a write-only share enabled.  In a write-only share any failure
    is mapped to EACESS unless the error is ENOENT when a new file is to be
    created.  The error check currently fails all errors when it should
    only allow creation of new files i.e., ENOENT with flags specifying
    O_CREAT.
    
    The check should be
       if (status == EACCES) goto exit

    [AppInfo] Tweak the gather loop only for a real config reload.
    
    The poll loop for the appInfo is being tweaked (destroyed and recreated)
    for every conf reload even when nothing related to appinfo changed.
    This may cause few scenarios where the 'application information'
    will never be collected inside the guest.  Fixed the code, to
    tweak the loop only when there is a real appinfo related config change
    in the tools.conf file.

    At few places in the code, the result from the RPC channel send APIs
    is explicitly compared with a harcoded "Unknown command" string.  We already
    have a well defined macro for that.  Changed the code to re-use the macro
    wherever possible.

    In error cases, RpcChannel Send APIs (RpcChannel_SendOneRaw,

    This changeset adds the MACRO for that error message.
    
    If there are any callers who compare the results (ex: ServiceDiscovery), they
    don't have to use 'hardcoded' messages and can reuse the MACROs.

    Use random poll-interval for appInfo on channel reset.
    
    In few workflows like instant clone, when a large number of VMs are
    cloned at the same time, if the appinfo plugin runs at the same time
    in all the VMs, the underlying ESXi may encounter heavy load.  To
    avoid these situations, a random poll interval should be used
    for the appinfo whenever applicable workflows are detected.
    
    Detecting a 'rpc channel reset' is a simple approach to detect.
    
    In this changeset, add the following changes:
    
    - Added a new callback function for the 'rpc channel reset'.  If
    the rpc channel is reset, a new random poll interval is calculated
    and poll timer is adjusted accordingly.  If the existing appinfo
    poll interval is greater than the minimum interval of 30 seconds,
    random interval will be generated between 30 and appinfopollinterval.
    If the existing poll interval is less than the minimum 30 seconds
    time, then random interval will not be changed.
    
    - Code refactoring for few functions.
    - Changed one global variable as static.
    - Added few debug/info log messages.

    Make Backdoor fallback temporary.
    
    When RpcOut falls to Backdoor, it stays with Backdoor
    permanently for the life of vmtoolsd service.  It is a
    long standing bug in the reset handling code.  Typically,
    channel type is not changed during reset.  Our reset
    handling code can either keep the channel type same or
    switch it from vsocket to Backdoor, but it can't do other
    way.  Though it is supposed to switch to vsocket on reset
    caused by events like vmtoolsd being restarted or VMX
    breaking the channel for some VM management operation.
    With this change when we start the channel, we always
    try vsocket first unless Backdoor is enforced by the
    caller.
    
    Using Backdoor for too long is not desirable because
    privileged RPCs can't be used on such channel.  So, we
    need to retry switching the channel back to vsocket
    periodically.  We don't want to try vsocket on every
    RpcChannel_Send call because that adds to overhead and
    increases the latency of RpcChannel_Send due to connection
    timeouts.  So, we retry vsocket with a backoff delay
    between 2sec-5min.
    
    As some RpcChannel callers intend to use Backdoor channel
    we need to differentiate between such usage from the
    callers that create vsocket channel and fallback to
    Backdoor.  Therefore, introduced a concept of mutable
    channel.  The vsocket channel is mutable as it can fallback
    to Backdoor and restore vsocket.  However, if a caller
    creates Backdoor channel, it will not be mutable and
    stay with Backdoor for its lifetime.
    
    As vmxLogger frequently connects and disconnects the
    channel for every log message and does not use any
    privileged RPC, so make it use Backdoor channel
    permanently to avoid frequent vsocket connections.
    
    Additionally, removed the redundant 'stopRpcOut' interface
    and renamed 'onStartErr' to 'destroy'.

    Add a retry loop to VSockChannelStart() to recover on start failure.
    
    On failure, a vsock RPC channel will eventually fallback to the
    backdoor channel.  Services that require or are limited to the
    priviledge RPC channel will fail.
    
    Adding a simple, limited loop in VSockChannelStart to retry the vsock
    channel start before ultimately switching to the backdoor channel.
    Retries are not done for "send once" operations.

	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.08.19)

	* configure.ac: remove support for Linux kernels < 2.6.9.

	* lib/include/vmtools.h, libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c, doc/api/services/util.txt:
	  add new log handled that allows appending to existing log files, and fix
	  an issue where old log files would be "rotated" whenever the config file
	  was reloaded.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c, lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c,
	  lib/include/appUtil.h: fix compilation issues on FreeBSD when unity
	  was enabled.

	* lib/dnd/dndLinux.c, lib/include/vmblock_user.h, tests/testVmblock/*: add
	  vmblock tests and, as part of the change, do some refactoring of vmblock
	  related functions.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/*,
	  toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c, toolbox/toolboxShrink.c: refactor the wiper
	  structures so that they behave the same on Win32 and other platforms, and
	  also reuse data structures already in use by other parts of the code. This
	  fixes an "use after free" issue that toolbox-cmd had on Win32.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoInt.h,
	  lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c, lib/guestRpc/nicinfo.x,
	  lib/include/guestInfo.h, lib/include/netutil.h, lib/include/slashProc.h,
	  lib/netutil/netUtilLinux.c, lib/slashProc/*,
	  services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: add support for sending more
	  network-related information to the host, such as routing tables and name
	  servers.

	* lib/hgfsBd/hgfsBd.c: don't log RPC errors when HGFS is disabled.

	* lib/hgfsHelper/*, lib/include/hgfsHelper.h, lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: new
	  library with functions to query information about HGFS; expose some HGFS
	  properties through VIX.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/hgfsServerPolicyGuest/hgfsServerPolicyGuest.c,
	  lib/include/hgfsServerPolicy.h: fix checking of whether an object belongs
	  to a particular share; this was causing issues with invalid information
	  being returned in certain cases.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/include/hgfsProto.h: changes to support new VIX API
	  calls (mostly affecting Win32 only).

	* lib/include/guestCaps.h, lib/include/unityCommon.h: add boilerplate for new
	  RPCs for setting windows as sticky / non-sticky (not yet implemented).

	* lib/include/hgfsProto.h: new definitions for the next version of the HGFS
	  protocol.

	* lib/include/xdrutil.h: make XDRUTIL_ARRAYAPPEND() more type-safe when using
	  GCC.

	* lib/misc/codesetOld.c: fix some issues with UTF16 -> UTF8 conversion.

	* lib/rpcChannel/rpcChannel.c, libvmtools/signalSource.c,
	  libvmtools/vmtools.c, libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: g_assert -> ASSERT.

	* lib/unityWindowTracker/unityWindowTracker.c: fix issue with z-ordering of
	  modal dialogs.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: fix some old config translation issues.

	* modules/freebsd/shared/*, modules/freebsd/vmblock/*: make vmblock work on
	  FreeBSD 8.

	* modules/freebsd/vmmemctl/*, modules/linux/vmmemctl/*,
	  modules/solaris/vmmemctl/*, : refactoring and code changes to support the
	  driver on Mac OS X.

	* modules/linux/vmblock/*, modules/linux/vmci/*, modules/linux/vsock/linux/*:
	  remove compatibility code for older kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: fix memory leak in HgfsAccessInt().

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: fix kunmap usage in vmxnet3_shm, and reset the
	  shared pages when the char device is closed.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.{c,h}, modules/linux/vsock/linux/util.c:
	  add vsock protocol negotiation for notifyOn ops. This allows the driver to
	  negotiate with the remove end which version of the notification protocol to
	  use.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/notify.c, modules/linux/vsock/linux/notify.h,
	  modules/linux/vsock/linux/notifyQState.c,
	  modules/linux/vsock/linux/vsockPacket.h: add pktOn protocol. This new
	  protocol improves performance by detecting changes in the queue state
	  instead of sending WAITING_READ and WAITING_WRITE packets.

	* services/plugins/hgfsServer/hgfsPlugin.c,
	  services/plugins/resolutionSet/resolutionSet.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: load plugins even when an RPC channel cannot
	  be instantiated (i.e., when running outside of a virtual machine); this
	  allows plugins to perform actions (at load time) also when running outside
	  virtual machines (e.g., to undo some configuration done when the OS was run
	  in a VM).

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: handle SIGHUP differently; instead of
	  stopping the service, just re-load the config data. This should make it
	  easier to integrate the tools service with other tools such as logrotate.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c, toolbox/toolboxcmd-stat.c: remove memory info query,
	  which didn't really return useful information.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.cpp: if the clipboard/primary with most recent
	  timestamp has no data on it, try the other before giving up during
	  copy/paste.

2009-07-22	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.07.17)

	* configure.ac: fix detection of "dot" and its usage in the doxygen config
	  file.

	* configure.ac, libguestlib/Makefile.am, libguestlib/vmguestlib.pc.in:
	  install vmguestlib headers and add new pkgconfig script.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/include/dndBase.h, vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}:
	  fix an issue where the DnD code would prevent drops to other windows in
	  Unity mode, instead of just intercepting drops to the desktop.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/dndGuest/dndRpc.hh, lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc,
	  lib/include/dndBase.h, vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}: fix an issue where the
	  host Unity code would cause an undesired drop event.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/dndGuest/dndRpc.hh, lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc,
	  lib/include/dndBase.h: cleanup mouse simulation code, and fix an issue
	  where a drag would be canceled if the contents were dragged out of a guest
	  and then back in.

	* lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc, vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.cpp,
	  vmware-user/dndUI.cpp, vmware-user/dndUI.h, vmware-user/dragDetWnd.cpp,
	  vmware-user/dragDetWnd.h: several DnD fixes; make the DnD code behave
	  more like other GTK applications (based on analysing the flow of signals
	  on a test widget), and get rid of one of the detection windows, merging
	  both the Unity and non-Unity windows. Also, some code refactoring.

	* lib/ghIntegration/*, lib/guestRpc/*, lib/include/guestCaps.h,
	  lib/include/unityCommon.h: add stubs for a few new GHI functions (setting
	  window focus, tray icon updates and enhanced app info) - currently only
	  implemented on Win32.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: examine WM_CLASS when determining
	  which DE Tools are running in. The previous code was failing to show a
	  few entries set as "OnlyShowIn=xxx" because checking WM_NAME wasn't enough
	  to properly detect the desktop environment in certain cases.

	* lib/guestApp/guestAppPosixX11.c: use gconftool-2 to detect the user's
	  browser, since gnome-open fails to open "file://" URLs which contain query
	  strings. Also, use "kde-open" when running under KDE.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c:
	  allow shrinking LVM partitions.

	* lib/include/appUtil.h: partial refactoring of icon retrieval code.

	* lib/include/dbllnklst.h, lib/misc/dbllnklst.c: inline linked list
	  functions.

	* lib/include/guest_os.h, lib/misc/hostinfoPosix.c: add a couple of
	  distros to the known distro list.

	* lib/include/netutil.h, lib/netUtil/netUtilLinux.c: add Linux interface
	  name, index lookup routines.

	* lib/include/system.h, lib/system/systemLinux.c,
	  services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c: fixes a few bugs in the backwards
	  time sync code, mostly due to unit mismatches.

	* lib/include/unityWindowTracker.h, lib/unity/unity.c,
	  lib/unity/unityPlatform.h, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unityWindowTracker/unityWindowTracker.c: expose two new properties in
	  the window tracker to save an RPC to retrieve those properties.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: add
	  support for "application providers", which allow plugins to add support to
	  new kinds of application frameworks through vmtoolsd.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: only enable GIO channels when Unity is
	  actually active.

	* lib/unity/*: cleanup old GTK1 code.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: don't complain if config file is empty.

	* modules/linux/dkms.conf, modules/linux/dkms.sh: fix dkms.conf, and provide
	  a script to create a dkms tree from open-vm-tools.

	* modules/linux/shared/vmci_queue_pair.h, modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c:
	  remove two (now) unneeded functions.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: code cleanups, properly initialize the list head,
	  and allow receives to timeout so that hibernation works.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c: fix
	  drivers for kernels 2.6.29+.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: add shared memory support for faster communication
	  between user space and the device backend; this doesn't affect the regular
	  driver functionality, but is used by some VMware code not part of Tools.

	* modules/linux/vsock/*: fix an issue where it was possible for users to send
	  VMCI datagrams directly to the hypervisor.

	* scripts/common/vmware-user.desktop: work around a bug in KDE where desktop
	  files with "NoDisplay" fail to autostart.

	* scripts/freebsd/suspend-vm-default: use netif to bring down interfaces,
	  since dhclient doesn't understand "-r" in the default install.

	* services/plugins/vmbackup/*: add some new code used by enhancements being
	  done in the Win32 version of the plugin.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: fix running in background when executing
	  vmtoolsd while relying on PATH.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am: point to the correct plugin install
	  directory.

	* toolbox/*: better command line handling in the CLI utility, plus some code
	  cleanup.

	* vmware-user/copyPaste.c, vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.cpp,
	  vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.h, vmware-user/dnd.c: properly unregister
	  RPCs to avoid multiple registrations (and the ensuing ASSERT) in certain
	  cases.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h}: change way data is retrieved from the
	  clipboard, using the gtk+ clipboard wait APIs (which turn out to be more
	  reliable than the previous approach).

2009-06-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.06.15)

	* docs/api/Makefile.am: replace all variables in the doxygen conf file with
	  the correct values.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c: try alternate file extensions during icon search.
	  Sometimes a package lists its icon as icon-foo.png, but the package didn't
	  include icon-foo.png.	 Instead, it included icon-foo.xpm.	 Ex: Ubuntu
	  8.04's hwtest.

	* lib/guestApp/guestAppPosixX11.c: change detection of the default browser so
	  that the new help system works; the help files are not yet available in
	  open-vm-tools.

	* lib/hgfs/*, lib/include/cpName.h, lib/include/cpNameLite.h,
	  lib/include/hgfsUtil.h: avoid compiling certain parts of the source in
	  kernel modules.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*: return correct error when files / directories don't
	  exist.

	* lib/include/hgfsChannel.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: added support for vsock
	  channel for HGFS.

	* lib/include/util.h, lib/misc/utilMem.c: un-inline a bunch of functions to
	  reduce the size of binaries.

	* lib/include/vm_tools_version.h: bumped Tools version.

	* lib/resolution/resolutionX11.c: fix for issue where the host would send
	  a "topology set" command with a top-left corner that was not (0, 0) and
	  cause the screen to be reconfigured in the wrong way.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c: check for errors in calls to
	  XQueryTree.

	* lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c: check return of fgets() to avoid compiler warnings.

	* libvmtools/vmtools.c: fix initialization of wiper library on Win32.

	* modules/Makefile.am: install vsock header file on Linux.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/*, modules/linux/vmci/*, modules/linux/vsock/*:
	  changes related to 64-bit Mac drivers, don't affect either the FreeBSD
	  or Linux drivers.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/hgfs.h: removed duplicate file.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/module.h: fix issue where two files would get the
	  same inode number in some situations.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c: re-probe vmxnet2 device features on resume
	  from hibernate, to cover the case where a VM is resumed on a platform with
	  a different version of the device backend (bug #2209565).

	* scripts/resume-vm-default, scripts/suspend-vm-default: use NetworkManager
	  to handle networking where it is available.

	* services/plugins/hgfsServer/Makefile.am, services/plugins/vix/Makefile.am:
	  fix installation of vmusr plugins that are shared with vmsvc.

	* services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c: fix backwards time sync.

	* services/vmtoolsd/cmdLine.c, toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: print build number as
	  part of "-v" output.

	* toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c: correctly ignore unsupported partitions when
	  shrinking.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: changes for the new help system, not yet available
	  for open-vm-tools.

	* toolbox/toolboxInt.{c,h}, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: some code refactoring.

	* vmware-user/Makefile.am: fix linking when compiling without gtkmm.

2009-05-22	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.05.18)

	* configure.ac, m4/vmtools.m4: check for PAM and enable PAM support when
	  available.

	* configure.ac, services/plugins/*/Makefile.am, tests/*/Makefile.am: avoid
	  the "-rpath" hack to create plugins, using plugin_LTLIBRARIES instead (and
	  manually fixing things when necessary). Thanks to Dominique Leuenberger for
	  the suggestion (and sample patch).

	* docs/api/Makefile.am: fix doc target directories.

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/deployPkg/*, lib/include/deployPkg.h:
	  remove the deployPkg code, which depends on some VMware code that is not
	  yet open source.

	* lib/backdoor/*, lib/hgfs/*, lib/hgfsBd/*, lib/include/*,
	  lib/include/compat/*, lib/message/*, lib/misc/dbllnklst.c,
	  lib/rpcOut/rpcout.c: as part of sharing code between user-level code and
	  kernel modules, some files have been tagged with more than one license.

	* lib/dndGuest/*, lib/include/dndBase.h, lib/include/dndMsg.h,
	  lib/include/unity*, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: implement mouse movement
	  from within the guest; this avoids a dependency on "unofficial" mouse APIs
	  in the VMware host code, making DnD more reliable, and makes a few things
	  (such as cancelling an ongoing DnD operation) easier.

	* lib/file/filePosix.c: make File_FullPath()'s behavior consistent when the
	  input path starts with a '/'.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegration.c: send more info about the "start menu"
	  contents to the host (only usable for Windows guests).

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: prettify the category names of menu
	  items. This is a temporary solution before actually reading this
	  information from .desktop files.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c, lib/include/guestApp.h,
	  toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c, vmware-user/foreignVM*, vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp,
	  configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/include/socketMgr.h, lib/socketMgr.*:
	  remove code related to "foreign VM" support, which was never really used.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c:
	  properly report disk info for LVM volumes.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsDirNotify*, lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c: add support
	  for directory / file monitoring. It's currently only implemented on
	  Mac OS X.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer*: fix issue where it was possible to
	  create a file on a read-only share on Windows hosts.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer*, lib/hgfsServerManagerGuest/*,
	  lib/include/hgfs*.h, services/plugins/hgfsServer/hgfsPlugin.c,
	  services/plugins/vix/foundryToolsDaemon.c: some refactoring caused by the
	  work to make HGFS support pluggable transports.

	* lib/include/procMgr.h, lib/procMgr/procMgrPosix.c:
	  remove ProcMgr_GetAsyncStatus().

	* lib/include/vmsupport.h, scripts/vm-support, xferlogs/xferlogs.c,
	  services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: new feature to automatically
	  collect support data from the guest from the VMware UI.

	* lib/panicDefault/*, lib/user/*: change file names to avoid clash with
	  another file (Mac OS linker doesn't really like that).

	* lib/rpcChannel/rpcChannel.c: try to reinitialize the outbound channel on
	  failure.

	* lib/vixTools/vixTools.c, lib/include/vixCommands.h,
	  lib/include/vixOpenSource.h: add backend for new VIX API call to list the
	  guest's filesystems.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: lazily open the log file, instead of opening it
	  during configuration of the log system. This way two processes can use the
	  same conf file and not overwrite each other's log files (assuming the conf
	  data is sane).

	* modules/Makefile.am, modules/linux/vmci/Makefile.kernel,
	  modules/linux/vsock/Makefile.kernel: don't store VMCI module symbols in
	  /tmp during build; this avoids a possible symlink attack that could cause
	  data to be overwritten when building open-vm-tools.

	* modules/*/*, vmblock-fuse/*: remove a lot of duplicated files by either
	  moving them to a shared location or reusing files that were already
	  available elsewhere.

	* modules/freebsd/vmblock/subr.c, modules/freebsd/vmblock/vmblock_k.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmblock/vnoops.c: fix a possible kernel crash caused by
	  trying to read / write to the mount point (something vmware-user does to
	  detect whether it's using fuse or non-fuse vmblock).

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/*: adds support for a generic msg framework that is
	  currently used to deliver hot-plug/unplug notifications; get rid of a few
	  divisions; fix a bug where pvscsi_probe could return 0 (aka success) if
	  a call to kmalloc() failed; remove a few unused fields.

	* modules/linux/shared/vmci*: mostly changes related to the host VMCI drivers
	  (removed user-level queue-pair daemon, added support for trusted VMCI
	  endpoints) to keep binary compatibility between the host and guest VMCI
	  drivers.

	* modules/linux/hgfs/inode.c: check host's access rights when checking file
	  permissions, so that permissions are correctly checked when the guest's
	  user id is different from the host's user id.

	* modules/linux/bdhandler.*, modules/linux/filesystem.c; modules/linux/tcp.*,
	  modules/linux/transport.*,: postpone opening the channels so that module
	  can load successfully even if shared folders are disabled on the host;
	  fix a synchronization problem between recv and close/open; allow
	  hibernation to work by timing out the recv thread; correctly handle
	  failures in recv, including injecting a dummy error to the pending
	  requests when the recv thread exits; move the recv code to the channel's
	  implementation so that it can be simpler.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c, modules/linux/shared/compat_pci.h: fix
	  Wake-On-LAN for 2.6.27 and newer Linux guests.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/*: changes to support trusted VMCI host apps;
	  pull out notification and stats logging code into their own files.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/vnode.c: do not substitute errors returned by
	  uiomove() calls with EIO, propagate returned error code (which is EFAULT)
	  up the stack.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am, scripts/common/linux/pam.d/vmtoolsd-x64,
	  scripts/common/linux/pam.d/64/vmtoolsd: install the 64-bit PAM config
	  file with the correct name.

	* services/plugins/powerOps/powerOps.c: fix running default scripts by
	  making sure the path to the script is absolute.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am, services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: use info
	  from the configure step to define the plugin path; this avoids requiring
	  a symlink to be placed in /etc/vmware-tools for vmtoolsd to be able to
	  find the plugins.

	* services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: send the build information to the host so
	  it's logged in the VM's logs.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c, toolbox/toolboxcmd-*, toolbox/toolboxCmdInt.h:
	  make string comparison case-insensitive on Win32.

	* toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c: properly finish the shrinking process by
	  sending the "disk.shrink" RPC to the host.

	* toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix showing default settings for power ops
	  scripts (should show default script enabled, not script disabled).

	* vmblock-fuse/Makefile.am: fix compilation on FreeBSD.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.cpp: disallow copy-paste text of size greater than
	  4MB, instead of truncating the data.

	* vmware-user/dndUI.*, lib/dndGuest/dnd.cc, lib/include/dndBase.h: remove
	  drag timeout callback (which was not needed), and add new signal to
	  indicate that a GH DnD was cancelled.

	* vmware-user/Makefile.am: remove C++ link hack (not needed now since
	  vmware-user has C++ code already).

2009-04-23	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.04.17)

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, docs/*: build API docs for vmtools; the
	  documentation files are provided under a BSD-style license.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, guestd/*, lib/Makefile.am, lib/guestInfo/*,
	  lib/include/vmbackup_def.h, lib/include/vmBackup.h, lib/vmBackupLib/*,
	  libvmtools/Makefile.am, services/plugins/vmbackup/vmbackup_def.h: remove
	  guestd from open-vm-tools, and clean up code in other places that was only
	  there because of guestd.

	* configure.ac, modules/solaris/vmblock/*, modules/solaris/vmmemctl/*: add
	  Solaris vmblock and vmmemctl driver sources. The vmmemctl module also
	  includes a user-level daemon (vmmemctld.c).

	* lib/conf/conf.c, lib/include/conf.h, libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: remove
	  unused config options.

	* lib/deployPkg/toolsDeployPkg.h: code refactoring.

	* lib/dnd/dndClipboard.c: if size of clipboard exceeds the maximum backdoor
	  packet size, only keep text data (dropping the RTF data).

	* lib/dnd/dndLinux.c, lib/include/dnd.h, lib/include/vmblock.h,
	  vmware-user/copyPaste.c, vmware-user/dnd.c, vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp,
	  vmware-user/vmwareuserint.h, vmware-user-suid-wrapper/main.c: detect
	  whether plain vmblock or vmblock-fuse is being used, allowing the same
	  executable to be used with either.

	* lib/dndGuest/*, vmware-user/copyPaseDnDWrapper.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}, vmware-user/dragDetWnd.{cpp,h}:
	  vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp: more DnD V3 protocol work.

	* lib/ghIntegration/*, lib/include/guestCaps.h, lib/include/unityCommon.h:
	  work related to mapping Outlook folders over HGFS and exposing the Windows
	  Recycle Bin to the host (doesn't really affect open-vm-tools).

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: restore the native environment when
	  launching external applications. This doesn't really affect open-vm-tools.

	* lib/guestRpc/*, vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h}: implement RTF and file
	  contents copy & paste.

	* lib/include/circList.h, lib/include/vm_basic_math.h,
	  lib/include/vm_device_version.h, modules/linux/*, modules/Makefile.am:
	  changes to share files between the user space code and the kernel code,
	  instead of duplicating the same source files in different places.

	* lib/include/rpcChannel.h, lib/rpcChannel/*, tests/testDebug/testDebug.c,
	  test/vmrpcdbg/debugChannel.c: some code cleanup, and fix crash when dealing
	  with multiple reset messages.

	* lib/include/system.h, lib/system/systemLinux.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: remove System_Daemon() (replaced with
	  Hostinfo_Daemonize()).

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h, lib/unity/*: ressurrect UNITY_RPC_WINDOW_SHOW
	  and UNITY_RPC_WINDOW_HIDE RPCs.

	* lib/procMgr/procMgrPosix.c: fix ProcMgr_IsProcessRunning().

	* lib/system/systemLinux.c: fix shutdown / reboot commands on Solaris; fix
	  rebuilding of native environment from variables set by VMware scripts (this
	  last one doesn't really affect open-vm-tools).

	* lib/unicode/unicodeSimpleTypes.c: speed up UnicodeIANALookup, and fix case
	  where C++ constructors could call UnicodeIANALookup before Unicode_Init()
	  was called by lazily creating the internal cache.

	* libguestlib/*: link libguestlib against libvmtools. This avoids having
	  two definitions of certain symbols (like Debug()) when an application
	  links to both libraries.

	* modules/linux/vmblock/linux/control.c: only set directory entry owner when
	  needed.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/bdhandler.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/dir.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/file.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/filesystem.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/module.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/request.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/super.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/tcp.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/transport.{c,h}:
	  cleanup use of atomic variables in HGFS; add a transport abstraction layer,
	  and add an initial version of a socket-based transport (not yet stable and
	  not yet supported by any released VMware product).

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: fix build on kernel 2.6.29.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_vsock.c: export more functions to other kernel
	  modules; some changes to statistics gathering code.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/filesystem.c: make module loadable on Solaris 9.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/vnode.c: unify mapping of HGFS to Solaris error
	  codes.

	* scripts/*: restart network before running user scripts in resume scripts.

	* vmblock-fuse/block.c: fix vmblock-fuse compilation on FreeBSD.

2009-03-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.03.13)

	* configure.ac: check for FreeBSD kernel tree when building modules; warn
	  about which version of make to use when building kernel modules on FreeBSD
	  and Solaris; add compiler defines for identifying Solaris 9 and 11.

	* configure.ac, modules/Makefile.am: handle SYSDIR on FreeBSD.

	* guestd/main.c, modules/solaris/vmhgfs/Makefile: remove HGFS-related that
	  is now obsolete with the recent changes to the HGFS module on Solaris.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c: default to the configuration dir when the power
	  script path is not absolute.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, lib/include/guestInfo.h, lib/netUtil/netUtilLinux.c:
	  handle case when all network interfaces have been disabled and send an
	  "unknown" IP address to the host.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: always send
	  TOOLS_VERSION_UNMANAGED from an open-vm-tools build, so there's no need for
	  a config file option anymore.

	* hgfsclient/*: make it link to libvmtools to avoid code duplication.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtil.c: update list of "skippable" apps when figuring out
	  an application's path.

	* lib/auth/authPosix.c, scripts/linux/pam.d/*, guestd/Makefile.am,
	  services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am : change the name of the PAM application to
	  "vmtoolsd" to reflect the new service name.

	* lib/dnd/dndFileContentsUtil.h, lib/dnd/dndInt.h, lib/dndGuest/*.hh, and
	  corresponding files in lib/include: relocate private headers.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegration.c, lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationInt.h,
	  lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c, lib/include/unityCommon.h: glue code
	  for Outlook mirrored folder, which does not affect open-vm-tools.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/include/vmGuestLib.h,
	  libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c: add new guestlib counters.

	* lib/include/conf.h, toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: remove the need for the
	  "helpdir" config option; this doesn't really affect open-vm-tools since the
	  help files are not yet included.

	* lib/include/guest_os.h, lib/misc/hostinfoPosix.c: more guest OS names; fix
	  name used to identify Solaris to match what VMware's host code expects.

	* lib/include/guestStats.h: documentation changes.

	* lib/include/hostinfo.h, lib/user/hostinfoPosix.c: add a new function that
	  behaves like daemon(3), but is more Mac OS-friendly.

	* lib/include/toolsLogger.h, lib/Makefile.am, lib/toolsLogger/*: removed
	  library, which is not used anymore.

	* lib/include/vm_basic_types.h, lib/misc/timeutil.c: fixes to compile under
	  (Open) Solaris 11.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, services/plugins/vmbackup/stateMachine.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/serviceObj.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: add new
	  signal handler to gather debugging information from a running vmtoolsd
	  instance.

	* lib/misc/posixPosix.c: fix off-by-one error.

	* lib/unity/unity.c, lib/unity/unityPlatform.h, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c,
	  lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c: always send Unity updates using RPCI;
	  this avoids a possible race between replying to an incoming RPC and sending
	  an Unity update from a different thread; also, API documentation updates.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: verify the DnD detection window was
	  initialized before actually using it.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c:
	  reset _NET_WM_DESKTOP as necessary before exiting Unity; this could cause
	  guest taskbars to disappear when in Unity mode.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unity/unityX11.h: examine WM_CLIENT_LEADER when gathering application
	  information; certain applications use this property to define the window
	  where the WM_COMMAND property should be.

	* lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: do not follow symlinks when deleting files in the
	  guest using the VIX API.

	* libvmtools/vmtools.c, libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: allow the logging subsystem
	  to be re-configured, and clean up the logging data when unloading the
	  library; allow ${USER} and ${PID} to be used in log file paths.

	* modules/freebsd/vmblock/subr.c, modules/freebsd/vmblock/vnops.c: fix kernel
	  panic on FreeBSD 7.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile: remove GCC version check.

	* modules/linux/*/compat_wait.h: fix COMPAT_DEFINE_WAIT for "vanilla" 2.4
	  kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/Makefile.normal: fix build of HGFS module on 2.4
	  kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/*, modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: avoid using compat
	  functions when they're not needed; add compatibility functions for
	  newer Linux kernels.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.c: fix two races; one when the socket
	  state changed between calls to VSockVmciRecvStreamCB and
	  VSockVmciRecvPktWork, and another when trying to read from the socket after
	  a RST arrived after the socket got a detach notification.

	* modules/solaris/vmxnet3/*: add Solaris vmxnet3 driver.

	* rpctool/*: add "rpctool", a simple, stand-alone tool to send RPC commands
	  to the host software.

	* services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: don't cache configuration
	  data.

	* services/plugins/guestInfo/perfMonLinux.c: fix problem with overwriting
	  flags after GuestInfoMonitorReadMeminfo() was called. (Same as fix to
	  lib/guestInfo on previous release.)

	* services/plugins/powerOps/powerOps.c: handle power ops-related options
	  sent from the host.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c: handle re-loading the configuration file.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: exec after forking on Mac OS, since
	  CoreFoundation classes don't work after a fork.

	* services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: allow both 32 and 64 bit plugins to be
	  installed on Solaris by loading them from the appropriate directory;
	  add library loading code that is not really needed (nor used) in
	  open-vm-tools.

	* services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: send another "capability" the host expects
	  from Tools.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: add F1 shortcut to invoke help.

	* toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix issue with freeing data that should not be
	  freed.

	* vmware-user/*: implement the new DnD protocol (V3).


2009-02-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.02.13)

	* configure.ac, m4/vmtools.m4: clean up a lot of the library detection code.

	* configure.ac: remove support for gtk+ 1.2 (code already depended on it in
	  any case); enforce need for glib 2.6.0 or later due to new code being
	  added; add detection for gtkmm; check for C++ compiler when it's needed;
	  reorder the include path to avoid clashing with system headers in some
	  situations.

	* guestd/foundryToolsDaemon.*, vmware-user/foundryToolsDaemon.*,
	  guestd/Makefile.am, vmware-user/Makefile.am: moved shared source files to
	  a new place to avoid duplication.

	* hgfsmounter/hgfsmounter.c: add support for Solaris.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c: fix loading of icons when the name has a period.

	* lib/dnd/dndClipboard.c, lib/dnd/dndInt.h, lib/dnd/dndMsg.c,
	  lib/dnd/Makefile.am, lib/dndGuest/*, lib/include/copyPasteBase.h,
	  lib/include/copyPaste.hh, lib/include/copyPasteRpc.hh,

	  lib/include/dndInt.h, lib/include/dndMsg.h, lib/include/dndRpc.hh,
	  lib/include/dndRpcV3.hh, lib/include/dndTransportGuestRpc.hh,
	  lib/include/dndTransport.hh, lib/include/libExport.hh,
	  vmware-user/copyPaste.cpp, vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/copyPasteV3.h, vmware-user/copyPasteWrapper.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/dnd.cpp, vmware-user/Makefile.am,
	  vmware-user/vmware-user.{c,cpp}, vmware-user/vmwareuserInt.h,
	  vmware-user/stringxx/string.{cc,hh}, vmware-user/stringxx/ubstr_t.hh: add
	  support for new version of the DnD protocol.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPerfMonLinux.c: fix problem with overwriting flags
	  after GuestInfoMonitorReadMeminfo() was called.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/include/vmGuestLib.h,
	  libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c: add new host stats.

	* lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am: fix a few compatibility issues with non-GNU
	  versions of make.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c, lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerInt.h,
	  lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c, */hgfsProto.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnops.c, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnopscommon.{c,h}:
	  don't trust the local VFS layer, check the HGFS server to see if an
	  operation would succeed.

	* lib/include/rpcChannel.h, lib/rpcChannel/*: add new Guest RPC channel
	  abstraction library used by the new "core services" code.

	* lib/include/vmrpcdbg.h, tests/*: add test code from the "core services"
	  project.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, lib/include/vmtoolsd_version.h,
	  services/vmtoolsd/*: add "vmtoolsd", the new service "shell" used in the
	  "core services" project.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c: don't send initial "region" updates for
	  shaped windows. This works around an issue where resizing a shaped window
	  would not work as expected in Unity mode.

	* lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c: fix major number detection for disks on newer Linux
	  kernels.

	* libvmtools/Makefile.am: link more libraries needed by vmtoolsd and the new
	  plugins.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c, modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi_version.h: use
	  PCI-specific memory allocation functions and update driver version.

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c: disable queue pair support in the host
	  version of the driver on older Linux kernels. This doesn't affect the
	  guest driver.

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmci_queue_pair.h: implement MSG_PEEK support on
	  Linux driver.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/bdhandler.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_sched.h,
	  modules/linux/vmmemctl/os.c: fix issue with HGFS module interfering with
	  suspend / hibernation on newer Linux kernels (bug #2523263).

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_cred.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/file.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/filesystem.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c: changes
	  for compatibility with newer Linux kernels, where it's not possible to
	  change fsuid/capabilities directly anymore.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_pagemap.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c:
	  fix warning, and compatibility changes for newer Linux kernels
	  (2.6.28.1 and newer; bug #2530616).

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c: fix creation of symlinks (bug #2531303).

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c: use PCI-specific memory allocation
	  functions.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: add option
	  to disable LRO.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_inet.{c,h}, modules/linux/vsock/util.{c,h}: add
	  MSG_PEEK support; remove ifdefs that were disabling support for queue
	  pairs on the host kernel module; fix compilation with certain versions
	  of gcc (bug #2531283).

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/*: move backdoor handling code to the HGFS driver;
	  this makes the user-level code to handle the driver (currently in
	  vmware-guestd) obsolete.

	* modules/solaris/vmxnet/*: add vmxnet driver for Solaris, under the CDDL.

	* services/plugins/*: add all currently available "core services" plugins.
	  The current set of plugins provide the functionality available in
	  vmware-guestd; there are a few plugins that replace functionality from
	  vmware-user, but not all features are ported yet (and vmtoolsd - with
	  vmware-user plugins - and vmware-user cannot run at the same time).

	* toolbox/toolboxAbout.c: fix the copyright character.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: reword a few messages, fix typos.

	* toolbox/toolboxCmdInt.h, toolbox/toolboxcmd-record.c,
	  toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c, toolbox/toolboxRecord.c: remove the "record"
	  functionality from tools (due to internal request).

	* toolbox/toolboxInt.c, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c, toolbox/toolbox-scripts.c:
	  changes to use the new config file format used by the "core services" code.

	* */Makefile.am: make sure 'rm' and 'mv' are being used instead of $(RM) and
	  $(MV) (which are not defined by automake; bug #2492040).

2009-01-21	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.01.19)

	* configure.ac: detect the presence of FUSE libraries.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: compile kernel modules for Solaris, and
	  vmblock-fuse module if FUSE is available.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: retrieved localized application
	  names.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c,
	  lib/include/hostinfo.h, lib/misc/hostinfo_misc.c, lib/misc/hostinfoPosic.c,
	  lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: refactoring to move code shared with other VMware
	  products to a common library.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am,
	  lib/include/vmGuestLib.h, libguestlib/*: add new iteration of the
	  "guestlib" protocol. This is a more extensible solution than the current
	  protocol, and should make it easier to add new information when needed.

	* lib/include/dynarray.h, lib/include/dynbuf.h, lib/misc/dynarray.c,
	  lib/misc/dynbuf.c: make some DynArray/DynBuf functions inline for speed.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h: more documentation about the Unity protocol.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: fix Unity<->guest desktop ID mappings.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: change the way log domains are configured; now
	  sub-domains inherit the default handler for the app if no handler is
	  specified.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.c, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnopscommon.{c,h}: implement support for mmap on
	  the Mac OS driver, which allows running executables from an HGFS
	  share. The FreeBSD module still does not support this functionality.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/transport.{c,h}: refactoring for sharing structure
	  definitions.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c, modules/linux/vmblock/linux/module.c,
	  modules/linux/vmci/vmci_drv.c, modules/linux/hgfs/module.c,
	  modules/linux/vmmemctl/os.c, modules/linux/vmsync/sync.c,
	  modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: add support
	  for Novell's proprietary module info tag ("supported").

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c: add support for VMCI queue pairs on
	  the host. This does not affect the driver when it runs inside virtual
	  machines.

	* modules/linux/vmci/*.h, modules/linux/vsock/*.h: some changes in the common
	  code to support Mac OS X, and also queue pairs on the Solaris VMCI module.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_vsock.{c,h}: add functions for registering with
	  the vsock driver from within the kernel.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile: add $(LINUXINCLUDE) to the compiler flags; this
	  allows compiling the modules against recent kernels which removed that
	  from $(KBUILD_CPPFLAGS).

	* modules/Makefile.am: add support for compiling Solaris kernel modules.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/*: initial release of the Solaris HGFS driver in
	  open-vm-tools. Driver is licensed under the CDDL 1.0.

	* vmblock-fuse/*: add the user-level implementation of the vmblock driver,
	  which is build on top of FUSE, to open-vm-tools. vmware-user hasn't yet
	  been modified to use this version of vmblock.

	* vmware-user/copyPaseV3.h: new header introduced during development of the
	  next version of copy paste / DnD for X11 platforms.


2008-11-23  Marcelo Vanzin  <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2008.12.19)

	* configure.ac, */Makefile.am: standardize on using libtool archives for
	  the libraries. This also means several makefiles were removed, since
	  there's no need to build two archives of the same library anymore.

	* configure.ac: add logic to detect glib 2.6; this is the minimum version
	  required by the "Core Services" project. Currently it's an optional
	  dependency.

	* configure.ac: disable Unity when user specifies --disable-multimon.

	* configure.ac: actually build the pvscsi modules if the detected kernel
	  version supports it.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, lib/guestInfo/Makefile.am,
	  lib/stubs/Makefile.am, libvmtools/*, lib/include/vmtools.h: add the
	  "vmtools" shared library used in the "Core Services" project. The library
	  is a collection of a lot of other libraries used by most VMware Tools
	  programs, and adds some functionality on top of glib that is used in the
	  "Core Services" project. Currently no other components from that project
	  are available as part of open-vm-tools.

	* lib/deployPkg/deployPkgLog.h, lib/deployPkg/toolsDeployPkg.h: moved private
	  headers out of the public header directory.

	* lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am, modules/Makefile.am: fix the makefiles so that
	  it's possible to build open-vm-tools from a directory different from the
	  source dir.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c: changes to support aliases on Mac OS hosts.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c: changes to map Windows attributes to
	  Mac OS FileInfo.

	* lib/include/circList.h: removed unused file.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h, lib/unity/unity.c: changes to add documentation
	  to various application RPCs used in Tools.

	* lib/misc/posixPosix.c, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix include path for
	  syslimits.h on FreeBSD.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: better detection of the guest's work area
	  boundaries; fixes a problem when dragging a Window in Unity mode with
	  the host's task bar on the left/right of screen would result in weird
	  behavior.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unity/unityX11.h: preserve the _NET_WM_DESKTOP setting when hiding
	  windows; this fixes a problem where hiding a panel and later restoring it
	  would result in the wrong _NET_WM_DESKTOP property being set for the panel,
	  causing it to only display on the first virtual desktop.

	* modules/linux/vmci/*: minor changes related to internal development of the
	  Mac OS drivers.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c: fix HGFS driver for kernel 2.6.28.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.c: added code to gather some performance
	  statistics for the driver.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: a few fixes to the help functionality.

	* vmware-user/vmware-user.c, vmware-user-suid-wrapper/main.c: change the
	  "blockFd" argument to have an extra dash so it follows the convention of
	  common command line parsing libraries.

	* Other bug fixes and changes in shared code that don't affect open-vm-tools.

2008-11-18  Marcelo Vanzin  <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2008.11.14)

	* lib/include/vm_version.h: Bumped TOOLS_VERSION.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, lib/include/vm_app.h: changes related to host-side
	  configuration of power operations.

	* hgfsclient/hgfsclient.c, lib/dnd/dndCommon.c, lib/dnd/dndLinux.c,
	  lib/hgfs/*, lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/include/cpName.h, lib/include/dnd.h,
	  lib/include/hgfsEscape.h, lib/include/staticEscape.h, modules/*/vmhgfs/*,
	  vmware-user/dnd.c: refactor the HGFS character escaping code; escape
	  invalid characters when the sender allows characters in the file name that
	  the receiver does not allow.

   * lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c: return proper error code when the
     remote path points to a non-existent directory.

	* lib/deployPkg/deployPkg.c, lib/deployPkg/deployPkgLog.c,
	  lib/include/deployPkg.h, lib/include/rpcin.h, lib/rpcin/rpcin.c:
     refactoring for the Tools Core Services project.

	* lib/dnd/dndCommon.c: don't ASSERT if the staging directory is not
	  actually a directory.

	* lib/dynxdr/xdrutil.c, lib/include/xdrutil.h: more XDR-related utility
	  functions.

	* lib/file/file.c, lib/file/fileLockPrimitive.c, lib/include/vm_basic_defs.h:
	  replace use of strtok with strtok_r.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, lib/include/guestApp.h: more utility functions.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, lib/include/backdoor_def.h, vmware-user/pointer.c:
	  add the ability to detect whether the mouse hardware can be used in
     absolute mode, which allows for auto grab / auto ungrab to work.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c,
     lib/guestRpc/nicinfo.x: provide the prefix length of an IPv6 address in a
     separate field of the NicInfo struct.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPerfMonLinux.c: reduce log spew.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c, lib/include/guestInfo.h: changes related
	  to how the VMware code in the host handles Tools version information.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h: changes related to documenting the Unity API.

	* lib/include/unity.h, lib/unity/*: remove a few unused RPCs, add a new
	  function used to notify the host of the status of Unity.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.c, modules/vmhgfs/freebsd/vnops.c,
     modules/vmhgfs/freebsd/vnopscommon.*: support symlinks on FreeBSD and
     Mac OS.

   * modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/worker.c: fix mutex not being unlocked in some
