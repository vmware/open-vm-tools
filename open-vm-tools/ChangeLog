    Update regex for checking 'disable_vmware_customization' flag
    
    The regex check for "disable_vmware_customization" is too strict and
    fails when there are inline comments after the flag. As a result, the
    cloud-init workflow doesn't start.
    This change is relaxing the check to allow inline comments. Please note
    that non-capturing group is not supported by POSIX regex API, using
    capturing group here.

    Define Posix_Printf/Posix_Fprint for FreeBSD
    
    A previous change to lib/misc/posixPosix.c introduced the
    `Posix_Printf` and `Posix_Fprintf` implementations only for non-Solaris,
    non-Apple, and non-FreeBSD builds. (Note that this set of
    conditions is inconsistent with when `posix.h` aliases them
    (and various other functions) to their standard POSIX
    counterparts.)
    
    Moving the `Posix_Printf`/`Posix_Fprintf` implementations out
    of the `#if` sections so that they're always available.

    permissions" and "Take ownership" of the file privileges from the user.

    Avoid potential pointer truncation in Util_Memcpy32
    
    `Util_Memcpy32` casts pointers to `long` types, but `long` is
    not necessarily large enough to store a pointer without
    truncation. (For example, Windows typically uses LLP64 where
    `long` is a 32-bit integer type on x64 systems.  Although
    `Util_Memcpy32` does its interesting work only for GCC, some
    parts of our build use GCC on Windows, and apparently that
    GCC configuration also uses LLP64.)
    
    Cast to `intptr_t` instead.

    Use different command to reboot linux VM, depending on the init system type
    
    We currently use the "telinit 6" command to reboot linux VMs.
    However, the "telinit" command will be unavailable in the future as SysVinit
    will be deprecated on some modern linux systems.
    
    For example: In SUSE, "telinit" command is part of systemd-sysvcompat
    (15 SP6 and newer) or systemd-sysvinit (older than 15 SP6), whereas in some
    SUSE images or templates such as SUSE minimal VM has no such packages installed.
    See SUSE KB: https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021564
    
    This change detects the init system of a linux and uses different command
    to trigger reboot. If the modern init system, systemd, is available, then
    "systemctl reboot" command will be used to trigger reboot. Otherwise, continue
    using "telinit 6" command as SysVinit, the traditional init system, is still
    available.

    Set the "patch" field of VMTools version to zero.
    
    Prior to VMTools 13.0.0, the fourth field in the VMTools version was set
    to PRODUCT_BUILD_NUMBER_NUMERIC which was the sequential build number
    of the product within the branch. Going forward, the fourth field
    of the displayed VMTools version is to be the "patch" starting with a
    '0' value.

    Update the AC_VMW_CHECK_LIB fields for xmlsec1 library.
    
    Currently, the library's custom "config" (xmlsec1-config)
    is being used to determine compiler and linker flags.
    Customer reported cross compiler problem with the xmlsec1-config
    usage and suggested the below changes to use pkg-config instead.
    
    o Pass library name as 3rd parameter to AC_VMW_CHECK_LIB Macro
      to determine the compiler and linker flags via pkg-config.
    o Also use the predefined 'PKG_CONFIG' variable rather than hardcoding
      'pkg-config'

    Provide a tools.conf setting to disable timesync plugin
    
    This change intends to address a customer issue that requires an
    in-guest config to disable timesync without having to reboot VM or
    restart. Although we have some ways to implement it from host side,
    customer claimed the guest administator may not be the administrator
    of vSphere so that an in-guest approach is still needed.
    
    This change adds two config options under "timeSync" group:
    - disable-all: This disables all time sync including one-time sync
    and periodic sync.
    - disable-periodic: This disables periodic sync only.
    Note we cannot disable one-time sync and keep periodic sync enabled
    as this is not allowed according to the product design.

    Fix the assembler warning
    
    The Warning "found movsd; assuming movsl was meant" was noticed while
    building open-vm-tools with gcc 12.2.0 (on Debian 12.2.0-14).
    It was because of the change https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29525
    made to the GNU assembler code (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.39.90.20221231.
    
    Replace the instruction "movsd" with "movsl" to avoid this warning.

    [config] Change to tools.conf ignored when time syncs backwards.
    
    Originally seen on Windows 2025:
    A guest start with a date+time that gets updated by a time sync process (ntp,
    timesync) that performs a significant jump backwards in time.
    
    *: Significant here as nothing to do with the size of the jump, but rather its
    timing.
    
    The VMware Tools 'tools.conf' file exists and was created in the original time
    configuration of the VM such that it's last modified time is current on boot and
    when initially loaded (read) by the VMware Tools service. The service will have
    saved this last modified timestamp for future comparisons.
    
    At a point after the VMware Tools configuration is loaded, a time sync occurs
    that updates the guest time backwards (Tx becomes Tx-y) such that the new time
    is before the VMware Tools configuration file's (tools.conf) last modified
    timestamp.
    
    After the time adjustment AND before the new time catches up with the old time;
    the VMware Tools configuration file (tools.conf) is updated.  Its last modified
    time changing from a time consistent with the old time to a time at or shortly
    later than the new time.
    
    When the VMware Tools service checks for configuration update, the saved and
    current 'last modified' timestamps are compared.
    
    The old comparison was performing a '<=' comparison to skip reading the
    configuration file, only re-loading the configuration for newer timestamps.
    
    In the conditions here, this check causes the configuration change to be ignored
    until the guest time catches up and passes the saved 'future' timestamp or the
    VMware Tools service is restarted.
    
    Change:
    Changing the last modified timestamp check to skip the configuration reload
    when the timestamp are the same (from '<=' to '==').

    Fix a couple of memory leaks in drag-and-drop/copy-paste code:
    
    * `CopyPasteRpcV3::HandleMsg` calls `CPClipboard_Unserialize`
    which allocates memory to the supplied `Clipboard`
    structure, but it neglected to call `CPClipboard_Destroy`
    to free it when done.  Also update the documentation for
    `CPClipboard_Unserialize` to make the contract more
    explicit.
    * `DnD_SetCPClipboardFromLocalText` completely neglected to
    free its destination buffer.
    
    Bonus cleanup:
    
    * Make some pointers `const` (which also allows us to remove
    some casts).
    * Replace a call to `UNICODE_RELEASE_UTF16` with `free` since
    the memory was allocated by lib/dnd with `malloc` and was
    not allocated by lib/unicode.

    [VMX][GuestOps] VM Denial of Service through guestops API requests.
    
    Using PowerCLI Invoke-VMScript; an arbitrary 'ScriptText' payload can be sent
    that will result in an internal vix request message that exceeds the
    VIX_COMMAND_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE limit (64KB at writing).
    
    Some guestops implementation do not check the result of call to
    VixMsg_AllocRequestMsg(), which can be NULL, before use; causing a panic and
    the VM (vmx) to crash/coredump.
    
    The check for VIX_COMMAND_MAX_USER_INPUT_SIZE in foundryVMGuestOps.c are ported
    to guestOps.c and additional checks are added to other site that call into
    VixMsg_AllocRequestMsg() within guestOps.c.

    Remove the single VMware Tools User Process enforcement
    override condition.
    
    When the mechanism to enforce the single vmusr process per vm
    was established, a user configurable feature disablement switch
    'maxChannelAttempts' (within tools.conf) was provided to override
    this restriction (to avoid any regression).
    
    Since this is no longer needed, removing the 'ToolsCore_GetVmusrLimit'
    function and avoid reading maxChannelAttempts from tools.conf

    vm_support update: gather log files based on the current tools.conf
    configuration
    
    The script's revised logic replaces the <variable>(s) in the data field
    value (logfile name) with a wildcard ('*') character, and it escapes the
    '$' sign in the sed match pattern to match the '${\<variable>}' syntax
    in the data field.
    
    The usage/help message for the subcommand "get \section> [key]" has also
    been updated.

    Annotate the os-release guest identification function HostinfoOsRelease()
    
    The HostinfoOsRelease() function examines the os-release standard file(s) to
    collect distro identification data of interest. This is open-source and users
    can legally modify the code changing the standard file priority order or
    accessing other files. Any such change breaks compliance with the os-release
    standard and may cause confusion in the field.
    The function header has been updated to remind users of this issue.

    Update settings for vmware-user.desktop.in:
    - Remove Encoding since it's deprecated.
    - Uncomment NoDisplay=True since the bug related to it was fixed
    a while ago.
    
    Delete bora-vmsoft/install/common/vmware-user.desktop as it is no
    longer needed. In open-vm-tools, vmware-user.desktop is generated from
    vmware-user.desktop.in.

    Verify the xmlsec version before passing the compiler flag "-DXMLSEC_NO_SIZE_T",
    as it has been deprecated since 1.3.3.
    
    The configure option "--enable-size-t" has been set to yes by default starting
    with 1.3.0.
    
    version < 1.3.0 :
      Add "-DXMLSEC_NO_SIZE_T" if size_t has a size other than 4 bytes.
      (There was no enable-size-t before 1.2.35 and the enable-size-t is
       "no" by default in [1.2.35, 1.3.0))
    version >= 1.3.0 :
      Do not add "-DXMLSEC_NO_SIZE_T" (as enable-size-t is "yes" by
      default in version [1.3.0, 1.3.3) and no need to consider this
      option since 1.3.3)

    [Coverity]: UNINIT in resolutionSet finding from static application
                security testing (SAST)
    
    resolutionSet.c -- 1 issue reported in the file
    issue: capabilityArray not initialized or partially initialized when
           reaching the statement.
    impact: False-positive
    fix: suppress 'uninit_use_in_call'
    
    VMTools_WrapArray converts the capabilityArray to a GArray.
    The 'wrapped' array is allocated space for capabilityCount elements and
    only the first capabilityCount elements are COPIED from capabilityArray
    to the allocated GArray.  As such, the uninitialized elements of the
    capabilityArray are never used to generate the returned GArray.  While
    technically true (uninitialized) there is no reason to zero the array
    indexes from capabilityCount through to the end of the array as these
    elements are unused.

    Service Discovery data collection duration takes > 70 minutes when
    monitoring large setups.
    
    The issue happens on vrops node VMs that are part of large clusters
    because these kind of nodes typically have a large amount of tcp/udp
    connections.  The root cause of the issue is an enormous number of
    spaces generated by "ss -antup | grep -E $pattern" command in
    get-connection-info.sh. The SDMP plugin considers these spaces while
    calculating the chunk size for writing into NDB and writing about 200-400
    chunks for the get-connection-info key.  Processing of this amount of
    data slows down the discovery process on both the adapter and plugin sides
    and, as a result, the discovery exceeds the timing limit and fails.
    
    The solution is to remove unnecessary spaces from the end of the
    get-connection-info output lines.

    [Coverity]: Fix the Y2K38_SAFETY findings from static application security
    testing (SAST)
    
    guestInfoServer.c -- 2 issues reported in file
    issue: casting time_t (64bits) to int (32bits) causing Y2K38_SAFETY.
    impact: delta is a time delta in seconds, overflow if delta >=
    (G_MAXINT/1000)+1
    fix: Remove cast on delta, cast both values as int64.
    
    issue: casting time_t to int for logging to a '%d'.
    impact: delta is a time delta in seconds, not expected to overflow a 32 bit
    int.
    fix: Remove cast on delta, change string to use '%"FMT64"d' format and cast
    the time_t to int64; time_t is defined as 'long int'.
    
    vixTools.c -- 7 issues reported in file
    issue: casting time_t to int for convertion to string (xml)
    impact: procStartTime is a time from epoch, it will overflow the int in Y2K38.
    fix: Remove the cast, change the string to use '%"FMT64"d"' and cast the
    time_t to int64; time_t is defined as 'long int'.
    
    issues: casting time_t to int in call to VixToolsPrintProcInfoEx.
    impact: The times used are time from epoch and will be impacted by Y2K38.
    fix: Change signature of VixToolsPrintProcInfoEx to take in time_t types.
    Change VixToolsPrintProcInfoEx to use '%"FMT64"d' in string conversions.
    and cast the time_t to int64; time_t is defined as 'long int'.

    Linux network log file permissions fix: 0644 to 0600
    Since release 11.3.5, on linux guests, the vmware-network.log file has root
    default	file creation permissions (0644) rather than the expected 0600
    permissions.
    
    Fix:
    - Adding chmod 0600 on log file creation.
    - Adding file creation before first logging.
    - Adding handling of unset handler in case switch, default to file logging.
    - Adding logging of unknown or bad handler, and using file logging as default.
    - Default number of logfiles when network.maxOldLogFiles is set to 0.

    lib/file/file.c: Handle EACCES during File_CreateDirectoryHierarchyEx
    
    On DELL thinOS, while creating an existing dir in a path without write
    permission, mkdir returns EACCES. This breaks the directory
    hierarchy check.
    This patch handles the EACCES by checking the file with euidaccess
    after an EACCES failure.

    Change in Guest Data Producer plugin API and Guest Data Producer
    protocol/handshake between the host and guest to support ‘no subscribers’
    error feedback.
    
    The Service Discovery plugin was updated for API compatibility.
    
    Changes in the GDP protocol/handshake introduce versioning of the protocol.
    The new version is “2” and introduces new attributes (‘version’ and
    ‘requireSubs’) in the guest request header sent to the host publisher service.
    The response from the host publisher service to the guest producer client is
    also versioned and changes more significantly: V2 response messages have new
    attributes (‘version’, ‘error-id’, and ‘error-text’) and have the ‘status’
    attributes type change from string (‘ok’, ‘bad’) to Boolean (‘true’, ‘false’).
    The ‘error-id’, when present, contains a string identifier for an error
    type/code and ‘error-text’, when present, contains textual details for the error.
    
    The host publisher supports all protocol versions up to the version it provides
    for backward and forward compatibility. The host publisher service responds with
    the same version of protocol as the incoming request or its highest protocol
    version when the incoming request version is higher than it supports.
    The guest producer client supports all response versions up to the version it
    provides for backward and forward compatibility. The guest producer client
    always sends request to the host publisher service using the highest protocol
    version it supports.

    File descriptor vulnerability in the open-vm-tools vmware-user-suid-wrapper
    on Linux
    
    Move the privilege drop logic (dropping privilege to the real uid and
    gid of the process for the vmusr service) from suidWrapper to vmtoolsd code.
    Now vmtoolsd is not executed with dropped privileges (started as setuid
    program) and the dumpable attribute of the process is not reset.
    Unprivileged users will not have access to the privileged file descriptors
    in the vmtoolsd vmusr process.
    Also, set the FD_CLOEXEC flag for both uinputFd and blockFd preventing
    those file descriptors from being inherited any further from vmtoolsd.

    Checking flag 'disable_vmware_customization' in more cloud-init config files
    
    Currently, the deployPkg plugin checks the existence of the flag
    'disable_vmware_customization: false' in the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file
    to determine whether VMware customization is enabled on cloud-init
    side when cloud-init is available in guest.  Instead, keep local settings,
    such as this flag, in config files under the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d directory,
    for example: /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/somefile.cfg
    
    This change implements the following adjustments to make sure this flag is
    handled the same way as cloud-init does in ds-identify and Datasource:
    
       1. Instead of regex matching flag 'disable_vmware_customization: false',
          check the value of flag 'disable_vmware_customization':
          If the value is 'false', it means VMware customization is enabled.
          If the value is 'true', it means VMware customization is disabled.
          If the flag is not set, by default VMware customization is disabled
          on cloud-init side.
       2. Besides cloud-init /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file, also check all .cfg
          files under /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d directory.
       3. The value of flag 'disable_vmware_customization' in .cfg files under
          /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d directory will overwrite the one in the
          /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg file.
       4. The value of flag 'disable_vmware_customization' in a .cfg file listed
          further down in alphabetical order under the /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d
          directory will overwrite the value in a .cfg file listed earier.
       5. If a cloud-init config file contains more than one instance of this
          flag, the value of the later flag will overwrite the former one.

    Provide alternate method to allow (expected) pre-frozen filesystems
    when taking a quiesced snapshot.
    
    Effective with open-vm-tools 12.2.0, Linux quiesced snapshots will fail if
    any filesystem(s) have been prefrozen by other than the vmtoolsd process.
    This has been done to assure that filesystems are inactive while the
    snapshots are being taken. Some existing prefreeze scripts may be freezing
    some filesystem(s). In these cases, the vmtoolsd process must be informed of
    anticipated pre-frozen filesystems by providing an "excludedFileSystem" list in
    the [vmbackup] section of the tools.conf file.
    
    This change provides a new switch in the tools.conf file to allow pre-frozen
    filesystems to be encountered and accepted when doing a quiesced snapshot
    operation. With the default value of "false", the "ignoreFrozenFileSystems"
    can be configured with a setting of "true" to notify the quiesced snapshot
    operation that pre-frozen filesystems are allowed.

    Removing appUtil library from open-vm-tools.
    
    Several Linux distributions have deprecated the use of gdk-pixbuf-xlib library
    and many may follow suit in future. Remove the appUtil library, which was
    required by Unity but is no longer supported on Linux guests.

    Improve POSIX guest identification

    Many Linux distros do not provide LSB information.  Instead,
    they rely exclusively on the the os-release standard information.

    We previously used a ranking system that rates the LSB data
    (if present) against the os-release data (if present).
    With the LSB data install much more rare than before, perform
    a quick check for the LSB before attempting expensive operations.

    This is in response to these GitHub issues:

    https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/647
    https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/648

    Note that we cannot look just for the os-release data.  In older
    Linux releases, there are mistakes or differences between the
    os-release and LSB data.  We must continue to do what we do now
    or risk changing the identification of older releases.

    This optimization is very effective.

    Add UNMANAGED InstallStatus value for components
    
    The UNMANAGED InstallStatus is returned from components operations to indicate
    that the component is installed (detected) but is not to be managed by the
    Component Manager.  The Component Manager will not take actions (except
    checkStatus) until the UNMANAGED status for the component gets resolved
    (externally).
    
    The Salt Minion (salt_minion) component returns code 106 ("ExternalInstall")
    is equivalent to UNMANAGED.

    Track Linux filesystem id (FSID) for quiesced (frozen) filesystems
    
    Tracking the filesystem FSID along with each file descriptor (FD)
    as the ioctl FIFREEZE is done.  An EBUSY could be seen because of
    an attempt to freeze the same superblock more than once depending
    on the OS configuration (e.g. usage of bind mounts).  An EBUSY could
    also mean another process has locked or frozen that filesystem.
    
    When an EBUSY is received, the filesyste FSID is checked against the
    list of filesystems that have already be quiesced.  If not previously
    seen, a warning that the filesystem is controlled by another process
    is logged and the quiesced snapshot request will be rejected.

    Linux guest identification: Make the code more robust.
    
    The code to read and parse the os-release data isn't doing a good job
    of protecting the tools daemon. Fixed this.
     - do not depend on sscanf.
     - bound the size of parameters;
     - better checking for syntax errors.

    to work around a problem in ESXi 6.0 ot 6.5 (KB 2149941), that guest VM
    may experience high CPU usage on open-vm-tools 12.1.0 and 12.1.5.

    [TimeInfo] Handle notifications and get updates
    
    TimeInfo, which is part of TimeSync plugin, can be
    used to query, set, subscribe, and receive updates for
    time-related information from the host when guest is
    using precisionclock to consume time from the host.
    Previous changes laid foundation to subscribe and
    unsubscribe for TimeInfo updates in open-vm-tools during
    init/shutdown.
    
    When open-vm-tools subscribes for TimeInfo updates, VMX
    will send a notification GuestRPC to tools if and
    when the timing properties change. This change
    adds support to handle such GuestRPCs from VMX.
    The handler for the GuestRPC is pretty straightforward
    for now: it queues an async task that simply gets
    all updates and logs them.

    Limit retry if the VMX RESETs a vsock connection
    
    If guest_rpc.rpci.usevsocket = "FALSE" is set, a vsock
    connect() will always fail with RESET. This confused code that
    thought it could only happen for secure sockets when they
    were quickly re-used.
    
    Limit retry, and only for secure connections.

    [TimeInfo] Subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications during init/shutdown
    
    This change adds support for subscribing to time info notifications
    when this feature is enabled in the tools. As a result VMX will
    send time info notifications to the tools when host timing
    properties change. The change adds support to perform subscribe/
    unsubscribe GuestRPCs from tools. Note that, handling of notification
    (received from VMX) will be implemented in the next change.

    [TimeInfo] Introduce TimeInfo in TimeSync plugin
    
    This change lays a foundation for upcoming changes to
    support TimeInfo feature in open-vm-tools. TimeInfo feature
    is introduced as part of TimeSync plugin and can be
    used to query, set, subscribe, and receive updates for
    time-related information from the host when guest is
    using precisionclock to consume time from the host.
    
    This change simply adds a new file and basic init/shutdown
    routines which are called as part of TimeSync plugin
    load/unload. The change also introduces a config option
    to enable/disable this feature (default is off). The
    feature is Linux-only for now.
    
    Upcoming changes will add support for subscribing and
    receiving TimeInfo updates.

    Enhance the guest identification code for Linux
    
    The Linux guest identification code is enhanced to return two
    additional fields (when a distro makes them available):
    
    1) The VERSION field
    
    This field sometimes contains additional information not
    found in other fields. For instance, on SLES, this provides
    the patch level information.
    
    2) The CPE_NAME field
    
    This is the NIST Common Platform Enumeration Specification
    string. If present, this may provide information in a
    standardized form.

    Add comments for two memory leak false positives reported by a
    Coverity scan of open-vm-tools.   Don't annotate since the
    annotations can't be made specified to the leaked variable, so
    that if an actual leak were introduced in the future an annotation
    would cause it to be reported as a false positive.
    
    For the same reason, replace a leaked storage annotation added
    previously with an explanatory comment.

    Avoid a vmtoolsd service error message if not on a VMware hypervisor.
    
    When open-vm-tools comes preinstalled in a base Linux release, the
    vmtoolsd services are started automatically at system start
    and desktop login.  If running on physical hardware or in a non-VMware
    hypervisor, the services will emit an error message to the systemd's
    logging service before stopping.
    
    This change removes the unwanted error message.

    Update the guestOps to handle some edge cases.
    
    When File_GetSize() fails or returns a -1 indicating the user does not
    have access permissions:
     1) Skip the file in the output of the ListFiles() request.
     2) Fail an InitiateFileTransferFromGuest operation.
    
    Properly handle the hostd request offset value returned in a ListFiles()
    guest operation when the results are truncated.

commit abd63f3785f8e4ec5384f55021b070be22c7cf8f
Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 13 10:31:15 2022 -0700

    Add a null undo function to the vmbackup null provider.
    
    If a snapshot operation times out, vmbackup can attempt
    to undo quiescing.  Since no quiescing is done for the null
    backup provider, no undo function was provided.  If vmbackup
    attempts to call the undo function, it dereferences a garbage
    pointer resulting in a segfault.
    
    Rather than add null backup provider specific checks to vmbackup,
    this change adds a null undo function to provide vmbackup with a
    valid function pointer it can call.  The new undo function updates
    the vmbackup state machine state with a new currentOpName, but
    has no other effect.  currentOpName is set to the calling
    function name, e.g. __FUNCTION__.

    Make Linux perl based customization work with the cloud-init workflow.
    
    To resolve issues seen where users want to set a vm's networking
    and apply cloud-init userdata together before the vm is booted, the
    deployPkg plugin has been modified to wait for cloud-init
    execution to finish.  This allows cloud-init to finish execution
    completely before the customization process triggers a reboot
    of the guest.
    
    This change is solely in the deployPkg plugin side, so a user can get
    this change by upgrading their open-vm-tools in the guest/template.

    Improve the "don't touch this" comments for Linux guest identification.
    
    Pull requests to add distro identification information are often submitted.
    Open-vm-tools does not own the guest identification code.  Such a change
    requires coordinated changes throughout the VMware product stack.
    
    Improve the text to reduce pull requests for changes to common source
    code that open-vm-tools does not own and cannot make.

    Generalize VMX RPC code in vgauthservice.
     - Rework the code so that it can used for other RPCs in the future.
     - Rework the code reading the RPC reply, since it can now be much larger.
     - Also remove the attempt to use the "guest.log.text" RPC since the VMX
       will just drop the logging on the floor with no error if the virtual
       HW version is too old.  A smart fail over is not possible.

    Adding configuration information for the GlobalConf feature.
    
    As part of the GlobalConf feature, a "globalconf" section is introduced
    into tools.conf to provide custom configuration options for the feature.
    The configuration parameters are as follows:
     * enabled=false - Enable/disable the GlobalConf module.
     * poll-interval=3600 - Poll interval for the GlobalConf feature.
     * resource=<path> - Defines the location of the tools.conf in the
                         GuestStore.  There is a separate default for Windows
                         and Linux guests.

    asyncsocket.c: Use size_t in place of int type for array size and indexing.
    
    Glibc 2.35 with GCC 11 and 12 produces additional warnings about strings
    and array bounds.  Switching from "int" to "size_t" type for variable
    used for the array size and element indexing.
    
    GCC warned when an integer value is passed as the size of the
    struct pollfd array to poll().

    AppVisibility: Skip terminated/stopped containers.
    
    Added code to skip terminated/stopped containers.  This is done
    by using TaskStub to retrieve the pid for the running container.
    If the pid cannot be retrieved, then that container is skipped.
    
    The previously suppressed "default" namespace has been restored.
    
    Fixed another minor issue with calculating the number of containers
    that were added.
    
    Note: This changeset introduces a dependency on Tasks.proto, and
    Tasks.proto depends on a few other proto files like mount, metrics,
    descriptor and task.  Modified the makefile to generate the necessary
    C++ files from the proto files.
    
    Additional notes:
     - .proto -> generates .pb.h, .pb.c and .grpc.pb.cc files.
     - For compiling and building the library (.so file), the .grpc.pb.{h,cc}
       and .pb.{h,cc} files are needed.
     - The protoc compiler generates .pb.h and .pb.c files when the --cpp_out
       option is specified.
     - The protoc compiler generates .grpc.pb.* when the --grpc_out option is
       specified.

    Update open-vm-tools to build with either Fuse 3 or Fuse 2
    
    Vendors are requesting that open-vm-tools can be built with either
    Fuse 2 or Fuse 3.  While both Fuse 2 and Fuse 3 runtime can be
    installed on a Linux system, vendors would prefer to switch from
    Fuse 2 to Fuse 3 at the same time for all products to be available
    with the base OS.
    
    Updating the configure.ac file to check for the presence of the Fuse 3
    or Fuse 2 development packages in the build environment.  Providing
    configure options to allow users to control the version of Fuse to be
    used.
     --without-fuse       - vmblock-fuse and vmhgfs-fuse will be disabled.
     --with-fuse=fuse3|3  - use Fuse 3.x
     --with-fuse=fuse|2   - use Fuse 2.x
     --with-fuse=auto     - check for Fuse 3 or Fuse 2 availability; disable
                            vmblock-fuse and vmhgfs-fuse if unavailable.
     --with-fuse          - implicit "yes".
     --with-fuse=yes      - check for Fuse 3 or Fuse 2 availability; disable
                            vmblock-fuse and vmhgfs-fuse if unavailable.
    
    Pull request: https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/pull/544
    Fixes issue:  https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/314
    
    The vmblock-fuse code is also used by WorkStation.  Configure defines
    are not available in internal builds.  Reworked preprocessor tests to
    use FUSE_MAJOR_VERSION from the fuse headers to determine API to be
    used during compilation.

    containerInfo Plugin: list the Docker and Kubernetes containers in a guest VM.
    
    Added code for a new open-vm-tools plugin, containerInfo.
    - Added a new configure option --disable-containerinfo to disable building
      the containerinfo plugin.
       --disable-containerinfo : Will not check for any dependent packages and
                                 will not build the containerinfo plugin.
       --enable-containerinfo=no : Same as --disable-containerinfo
       --enable-containerinfo=auto : Checks for the dependent packages. If they
                                     are available, then the containerinfo plugin
                                     will be built. Otherwise, a warning is printeds
                                     and the containerinfo plugin will be skipped.
       --enable-containerinfo
       --enable-containerinfo=yes  : Checks for the dependent packages. If they are
                                     available, then the containerinfo plugin will
                                     be built.  Otherwise, the configure will
                                     terminate with an error.
    
    - Updated the sample tools.conf file with various settings related to
      the containerinfo plugin.
    - Due to an issue reported in https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9184,
      implemented a workaround by changing 'import weak ' to 'import ' in the
      .proto files while generating the header files.

        when the logginging handler is configured to "vmx" or when the logfile
        is full or is not writeable.

    Customization: Retry the Linux reboot if telinit is a soft link to systemctl.
    
    Issues have been reported on some newer versions of Linux where the VM
    failed to reboot at the end of a traditional customization.  The command
    '/sbin/telinit 6' exited abnormally due to SIGTERM sent by systemd and
    where telinit is a symlink to systemctl.
    
    This fix checks if telinit is a soft link to systemctl and if yes, retries
    a system reboot until the telinit command succeeds or the reboot literally
    happens.

    Remove unwanted "volatile" from static variable used with g_once_init_enter()
    
    The glib api documentation for g_once_init_enter() specifically states
    that "volatile" should NOT be used with the address passed as the
    argument.  Recent compilers (GCC-11 & clang 11) and recent versions of
    glib-2 will result in a warning that the "volatile" qualifier has been
    dropped if it has been used.
    
    Remove the unneeded and unwanted "volatile" qualifier from the definition
    of "inited" in pollGtk.c.

    Common header file change not applicable to open-vm-tools.

commit c693dcf8212bcb01827cf131910e1d66132f50e1
Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Thu May 20 11:38:38 2021 -0700

    Common source file change not directly applicable to open-vm-tools.
    
    Introduce peek() to the asyncsocket API, only supported by TCP vtable.
    
    Peeks are similar to recv(), except that they do not drain the socket
    after reading.  Subsequent peek/recv reads the same data back.  However
    since recv does SSL_Read, a recv() following a peek() may not get the same
    data as peek() after SSL is initialized.  This is not a problem when
    peeks are done before SSL setup.
    
    Implementation notes:
    
    - peek is a one-shot operation. The poll callback is unregistered
      once it fires (recv keeps the callback until recv is cancelled).
    - non-partial peek is not supported, so the peek callback will be fired when
      any amount of data less than or equal amount of the requested length is
      available in the socket buffer.
    - It is possible to invoke recv() or peek() recursively from within the peek()
      callback.  A peek is disallowed from within the recv() callback.

    Fix an ASSERT in bora/lib/misc/timeutil.c.
    
    Fix a problem with TimeUtil_NtTimeToUnixTime on Arm that was encountered
    when running tools tests on Apple silicon.  The problem was the routine
    assumed that a variable was 32-bits if VM_X86_64 was not defined.  This
    may have been true in the past, but it is no longer true now that the code
    is also built for 64-bit Arm.

    1) Use the VM_SAFE_STR macro for string null check.
    2) Since free() is NULL safe, remove the "if" check before the free().
    3) Fix an alignment issue.

    VGAuth: Use GUESTRPCPKT_FIELD_FAST_CLOSE flag for log messages.
    
    VGauth is a single action service.  With the GUESTRPCPKT_FIELD_FAST_CLOSE
    flag added, VMX closes the vsocket as soon as the RPC response is sent.
    This cleans up the vsocket connections faster and minimizes the number
    of connect() failures in the guest.

    Asyncsocket: Add comments about AsyncSocket_SetErrorFn usage.
    
    Document that AsyncSocket_SetErrorFn must be called before an internal
    asyncsocket callback can fire and trigger a call to the error handler.
    The error handler must be set immediately after the asyncsocket is created,
    either from the poll thread, which requires no additional synchronization,
    or while holding the asyncsocket lock, which is passed via pollParams.

    that it is available for all plugins.  Modified the powerOps code
    accordingly.

    Fix issues using GCC 11 with gtk >= 3.20 and glib >=2.66.3
    
    With glib2.0 releases >= 2.66.3, glib header files inside an
    extern "C" block will encounter compilation errors.  This has
    impacted several OSS packages.  Consumers of newer versions of glib2.0
    must not include glib headers in an extern "C" block.
    
    GTK 3.20 has deprecated gdk_display_get_device_manager(); using the
    newer gdk_display_get_default_seat() when the GTK version is >= 3.20.
    
    The return value from read() must be used to avoid an unused result
    warning from the compiler.  This can be avoided by using dummy retyping
    in the case where the return value is not used or in this case, using
    the returned value in a debug log message.

    * Changed '%c' to '0x%02x' in the log messages to avoid any issues with
      printing the invalid/unprintable characters.
    
    * Added a new log message for better debugging in one specific error
      code path.

    Linux guest identification: Support multiple architectures.
    
    Allow machine architecture information to be present in the
    "short string" and the guestOS string.  This is done via a prefix,
    "<arch>-" (e.g. arm-ubuntu-64, riscv-debian11-64, arm-windows10-64)
    with the X86 architecture being implied (no explicit "<arch>-").
    
    Add the recognition of the Arm machine architecture to the Linux
    guest identification code.

    Implement log redirection for the deployPkg plugin.
    
    On Linux, /var/log/vmware-imc/toolsDeployPkg.log is the default deployPkgs
    log file.  This change allows users to redirect that log to the vmware.log
    on the host or to another file located on the guest VM.  Redirection is
    controlled by settings in the "logging" section of the tools.conf file.
    
    See the examples in the sample tools.conf file provided in the distribution.

    Configuring OVT with the --without-pam option will implicitly disable vgauth.
    
    When no vgauth option is given alongside -–without-pam, a warning
    is displayed with a message “Building without PAM; vgauth will be
    disabled.”.
    
    When -–disable-vgauth is supplied alongside –-without-pam, no
    warning or error message is displayed.
    
    When -–enable-vgauth is supplied alongside -–without-pam, an
    error will be thrown and the configure stage will be aborted with an
    error message “Cannot enable vgauth without PAM. Please configure
    without --without-pam or without --enable-vgauth.”

    tools/vmwgfxctrl: Add a command line tool for controlling vmwgfx.
    
    vmwgfxctrl is a small command line tool used to control various
    aspects of the vmwgfx kernel driver.  Currently it can both
    display and set current topology of the vmwgfx kernel driver.
    
    It should be distributed alongside other open-vm-tools binaries.
    It's incredibly useful when trying to set custom resolution on any
    recent distro (that includes multi-monitor setups).

    stringxx: Replace usage of deprecated glibmm function
    
    Glibmm::RefPtr::clear() has been deprecated for a while and was removed in
    2.51. The reasoning is listed in the 2.44 header:
    
    "/// @deprecated Use reset() instead because this leads to confusion with
    clear() methods on the underlying class."
    
    reset() has been available since 2.16, so it is trivial to switch to it.

    Gcc is now "always" at least gcc-4.4 (checked in vm_basic_types.h),
    which means many conditionals for earlier gcc can be removed.

    [open-vm-tools part] Support raw cloud-init data in VM customization.
    
    To support this feature, open-vm-tools needs to check whether cloud-init
    can support raw cloud-init data; then copy the data to the cloud-init
    cfg directory.

    Header file updated with errors detected when using raw cloud-init data
    in guest customization.
      - cloud-init version is too old to support raw cloud-init data.
      - cloud-init meta data format is invalid.

    resolution: Fix kms autodetection
    
    Currently, the elf binary of the xorg driver is loaded to check for a
    string that was put in the .modinfo section in the driver.  Unfortunately
    there are two problems with this approach:
    
      1) Distros now ship without xorg, so the xorg .so doesn't exist and
         there's nothing to check.
      2) Distros (e.g. Fedora) do heavy optimizations and remove the .modinfo
         section from the .so, so the string cannot be found even though the
         driver exists.
    
    To fix both, stop depending on being able to parse the elf binary of the
    xorg driver.  Instead, let the plugin check for the existence of the drm
    driver with a sufficiently high version, and if it exists, use kms.
    This removes the dependency on X for kms.  Also increase the version of
    vmwgfx required to ensure atomic mode-setting plus relevant bug fixes (in
    the kernel since 2017) are available.

    Add a switch to the vm-support script to transfer the support bundle to the hypervisor
    
    The vm-support script unconditionally transferred the support bundle to
    to the VMware hypervisor, thereby filling vmware.log.
    This fix changes the default behavior of the Linux and Windows scripts
    to *not* transfer the logs to the host.
    
    Added an option '-x' to both scripts to let the user elect to
    transfer the guest support bundle to the host.

    Add NVMe capability for vmbackup.
    
    The vmx/vmbackup logic checks if tools/vmbackup can support NVMe.  If it
    is supported, vmx/vmbackup can further go through the app quiesce process.
    Otherwise, vmx/vmbackup requests the filesystem quiesce process.

    Fix an issue where CustomizationUnknownFailure is generated multiple times
    on Linux.
    
    For Linux, sysimage sends a failure status to VMX when the deploy pkg
    failed.  The tools plugin then sends the failure notice again.  Changing the
    plugin to only send the failure notice for Windows guests where the
    failure has yet to be logged.

    Customization: Set log level to info, not error, for failed /sbin/telinit command
    
    The error message of a failed /sbin/telinit command is confusing for
    customers who might think customization failed.  On some Guest OSes,
    the repeatedly executing /sbin/telinit command can fail while a reboot
    is happening and the init daemon has been killed.
    This change sets log level to info, not error, for failed /sbin/telinit
    command.
    Note: The first /sbin/telinit commmand failure will fail customization
    with error 127; this is unchanged.

    [resolution/x11] Preserve the rotation
    
    The screen orientation/rotation was being reset on each mode set.
    In general that is not a bad behavior.   But it does break with a
    fit to window and such as it will continuously reset the user
    requested orientation.
    This patch preserves the orientation/rotation on mode changes.

    Log file name becomes invalid after a rotation
    
    This is because the accounting is done unsigned but the printf used (in
    multiple places) was "%d".  Fix this by using "%u".
    
    As documented in the function header, the wrap around case was not handled
    properly, so this was fixed as well.  If the maximum rotation number hits
    MAX_UINT32, all of the files are renamed to pack the files as if this was
    the beginning of a rotation sequence.

    OVT: Build only fuse-based or kernel module vmblocktest programs.
    
    The OVT configuration determines whether open-vm-tools will build
    a vmblock kernel module or a vmblock-fuse user level VMBlock
    implementation.  Both versions of the vmblocktest program(s) are not
    needed.   Linux OVT is only using the vmblock-fuse implementation.
    
    Select the version to build based on the HAVE_FUSE setting from the
    ./configure run.

    MXUser Semaphores - nanosecond resolution wait times
    
    The graphics team requested the ability to have semaphore wait times
    less than a millisecond.  This would greatly improve some graphics
    operations.  Since POSIX platforms (i.e. ESXi, MacOS, Linux) support
    nanosecond resolution for semaphore wait times, a new timed semaphore
    wait routine with nanosecond resolution is introduced.

    Fix propagation of libtirpc flags into build of test source.
    
    Starting with glibc 2.32, the Linux libc<n>-dev no longer provides
    the /usr/include/rpc/rpc.h header.  The configure script will detect
    the availability of the libtirpc package and use the rpc.h header
    from /usr/include/tirpc/rpc/rpc.h.
    
    This fix extends the necessary compilation and linking options to the
    build of the open-vm-tools services test programs that utilize RPC.

    Add a usage message for the "checkvm" utility.
    
    This change alters the functionality of the -h option to print a
    usage message by using glib options.  The previous functionality of -h
    was to print hardware version, which prints invalid results.  This
    change also removes a repeated header file and removes the -r option
    which prints invalid results.

    Change the default Unicode error errno.
    
    In times long past, EINVAL was chosen for the errno returned when a
    Unicode problem was detected.  This overloads EINVAL, particularly when
    using POSIX system calls.  Unfortunately, the overloading makes it very
    difficult to recover from some errors as there is no way to know the
    difference between a "real" EINVAL and a Unicode problem EINVAL.
    
    Over 10 years of data shows that we *RARELY* encounter Unicode errors.
    Inspecting the source base shows the code segments that do check for
    errno after an error either:
    
    1) Post the errno value and die.
    2) Have switch handle cases but also have a default catcher.
    3) Have an if/else waterfall with a final else.
    
    Another observation is that Unicode routines are not involved with
    anything that would return a math related errno (e.g. ERANGE, EDOM).
    
    Changing the value of UNICODE_CONVERSION_ERRNO to ERANGE and avoid
    any overloading.

    Update vm_basic_types.h for apple silicon
    
    Apple silicon compilers will define __arm64__ as their
    name for their new CPU. But they also define __aarch64__ which
    existing 64-bit ARM CPUs use.  Add a little bit of logic
    to enforce and document this.

    [GlobalConf] Support for vmusr service to load Global Configuration.
    
    Currently, the vmsvc service periodically downloads the Global Configuration
    from the GuestStore and applies the downloaded configuration.  'vmusr'
    service doesn't have the support.  In this changeset, made the changes
    for both vmusr and vmsvc services to periodically check and apply
    the changes.
    
    To keep thing simple and easy, the new approach is check the
    modification time every time the regular tools conf is read and if
    changes are detected, the configuration is applied.  With this new approach,
    signalling mechanism is not needed and that code is removed.
    
    vmsvc:
    * Starts a background thread which periodically fetches the global
    configuration from the GuestStore.
    
    vmusr:
    * No background thread is created. But checks and loads the configuration
    everytime the regular tools.conf is checked.

    hostinfo.h: stop including x86cpuid.h
    
    With the removal of Hostinfo_GetAllCpuid in an earlier change, hostinfo.h
    can stop including x86cpuid.h and only needs vendor IDs from x86vendor.h.
    
    Unfortunately, quite a few source files depended in hostinfo.h's automatic
    inclusion of x86cpuid.h. Fix them to include what they need.
    
    The lib/include/guestStats.h is a special case that happened to succeed because
    of a warning that was disabled in x86cpuid.h which also happens to have
    been included earlier than this header.  Re-disable the warning.

    Ensuring vmtools utilities are only used in a VMware virtual environment.

    In several files, replies/results from RPC functions can possibly be
    null if the function fails.  This changeset adds a function-like macro
    which does the null checks and is applied to the replies when passed
    into logging functions.

    LOG: Keep the LOG_LEVEL entries sorted
    
    This is the first in a series of changes to the Log Facility that will add
    the ability to have domain specific filtering (e.g. foobar domain can have
    log calls which are filtered by domain (name) and level).  This will make
    LOG like abilities usable in all build types, even a release build.
    
    The LOG_LEVEL entries are difficult to find since they are in a jumbled
    order.  The existing grouping isn't useful as many of the modules are shared.
    Create one big sorted list.

    Add --cmdfile argument
    
    Some OSes (Windows) have a relatively small cmdline limit.
    Expose a cmdfile argument which works like --cmd, but
    reads the input from a file.  This allows RPCs which can
    have huge arguments (guestVars, namespaceDB, DataSets) to work.

    [HGFS Server] Add file attributes/symlink check status cache using oplock support
    
    An investigation found that while copying a group of small files from host
    to guest using the shared folder, the HGFS_OP_GETATTR_V3 message was handled
    in HGFS server 276,140 times over a period of ~35 seconds.
    
    Caching the file attributes in HGFS on the server-side can reduce the time
    significantly (from experimental results, 35s => 8s).
    
    It was also discovered that Posix_RealPath is called repeatedly to check
    whether a path is a symlink, since HgfsServerGetLocalNameInfo is called when
    handling a series of requests.
    
    Integrate a key-value cache to HGFS server to cache the symlink check results
    and file attributes, using the file path as the key.  This task will be divided
    into multiple change:
    
    1. Add oplock support
    2. Add a customized LRU cache in HGFS server for file attributes and
       symlink check results
    
    -  New files:
       hgfsCache.h/c: implements a customized LRU cache which is built by
                      combining two data structures: a doubly linked list and
                      a hash table.
    
    -  The cache will be allocated only when oplock is enabled.
    -  The cache relies on the file change monitor provided by oplock to ensure
       there is no stale data.  When adding an entry into the cache, also
       register the file change callback to oplock.  Upon receiving the file change
       callback, invalidate the cache.  Once the cache is full, remove the LRU
       entry and unregister the file change callback for it.

    [HGFS Server] Support oplock inside HGFS server for Windows host
    
    Missed two source files for previous HGFS Server changeset.

commit 31978d3150e9730e75266689e18404f49430ca44
Author: John Wolfe <jwolfe@vmware.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 7 12:03:24 2020 -0700

    [HGFS Server] Support oplock inside HGFS server for Windows host
    
    The motivation for this change is to cache file/directory related information
    in host side, for example the file/directory attributes.  To make the cache
    correct, we will use the oplock(Windows)/lease(Linux) to monitor the
    file/directory change event.  When the file/directory changes, the item in
    cache will be invalidated.
    
    In this change, two new functions are defined:
    - HgfsOplockMonitorFileChange
       This function is used to monitor the change event for a file/directory,
       and the callback will be called if file/directory is changed.
    - HgfsOplockUnmonitorFileChange
       This function is used to cancel the change event monitoring.
    
    This patch only implements the oplock support for Windows host, the support
    for Linux will be delivered in another patch.

    GOSC event doesn't report at once after customization process timer is reached
    
    When process timer is reached, the command process is killed and function
    ProcessRead is called to read all the output till EOF.  But EOF can't be
    reached immediately.  The reason is pre-customization script is launched
    by perl script, and killing perl script process doesn't kill the
    pre-customization script process.
    This code update includes:
    1. Do not read stdout/stderr when gosc command process exits abnormally
       to avoid the EOF blocking.
    2. Add READSTATUS_PENDING_TO_EOF in enum ReadStatus to avoid the confusion
       with READSTATUS_PENDING.
    3. Close the write ends of pipes (stdout[1]/stderr[1]) for child command
       process before it exists.
    4. In processPosix.c, the write ends of pipes have been closed in line 180,
       181, so the read ends should be closed in line 254, 255.
    5. Add explicit note for the beginning and the end of the perl script log.

    hostinfoPosix: remove NOT_IMPLEMENTED() when NO_IOPL
    
    When running "vmtoolsd -b pidfile" on Linux arm64, we hit this error:
    
       [error] [vmsvc] NOT_IMPLEMENTED hostinfoPosix.c:2526
    
    Linux arm64 does not implement iopl() and the Hostinfo_ResetProcessState()
    is raising a NOT_IMPLEMENTED() because of that.  However if there's no iopl(),
    there is no reason to drop IO privileges, so we can just skip that code.
    
    This change also restores usage of getloadavg() for non Android arm64
    platforms: ESX vmx and tools for Linux arm64.

    Code cleanup to address a Coverity issue.
    
    Coverity reports a "dereference after NULL check" in
    BkdoorChannelStart.  However, at the point of dereference
    it's known that chan->inStarted is TRUE, which means chan->in
    is guaranteed to be non-NULL, so it's not a bug.
    
    Still, given that an input channel, if present, must have been
    started before calling BkdoorChannelStart, it's possible to do
    some code cleanup that will also get Coverity to stop reporting
    the issue.  Change what's currently a test into an ASSERT, test
    chan->in rather than chan->inStarted, and add comments to make
    it clearer what's going on.

    Improve Linux guest identification function documentation.
    
    Make it clear that the "short name" of a Linux distro has a default
    value and that the default value should not be overwritten unless
    VMware does this.
    
    If someone cheats and sends down an unsupported "short name", the
    guestMapper will protect the software stack, mapping the unsupported
    "short name" to that of the guestOS config found in the VMX file.
    We know that is OK since the VM couldn't power on and run the guest
    unless it was valid.
    
    All older, supported ESXi have updates that contain the guestMapper.
    
    If the guestMapper is not in place - an older, unpatched release -
    the software stack can become confused causing problems and crashes.

    Make peeking back into the stack work for back traces
    
    GCC 10 doesn't like peeking back before the end of an arrary (which
    is used to peek into the stack).  Fix this.

    serviceDiscovery: Updating 'get-versions.sh' script
    
    The following changes have been made:
    
    1. Environment variable 'ALIVE_BASE' is used to construct the path of
       the file where vcops version is stored.  The variable is not avialable
       when running the script inside serviceDiscovery plugin process, so a
       hardcoded path is used.
    
    2. Added command to retrieve tcserver version

    Deprecate VMGuestLib_GetHostMemKernOvhdMB GuestSDK API.
    
    * GUESTLIB_HOST_MEM_KERN_OVHD_MB metric was already deprecated in ESXi
      starting from 7.1.  It's time to deprecate the corresponding
      VMGuestLib_GetHostMemKernOvhdMB API in GuestSDK.  The documentation
      will be update denoting that this API is deprecated.
      After one or two releases, the API will be removed completely.
      Untill then, the API is modified to explicity return 0 for the metric.
    
    * Only a few functions listed in vmGuestLib.h are exposed in the vmGuestLibJava
      interface.  The remaining functions are encapsulated in '#ifndef SWIG'
      to hide them from SWIG utility which is used to generate the Java bindings.
    
    Note: The external customer facing documentation for this API will be
          documented later.
    Note: Once this changeset is submitted, the vmStatsProvider module
          will be updated to stop using the deprecated API.

    GuestSDK and vmtoolslib cleanup.
    
    * Removed the vmtools dependency for guestsdk.  This has been already
      done for tar tools build/target.  The same is being done for OVT
      builds.
    
    * Used various static libraries for building guestlib in OVT instead of
      depending on vmtoolslib.  Similar thing has already been done for
      appmonitor library in OVT.
    
    * GuestSDK_{Panic|Debug|Warning|Log} functions in vmtoolslib are not used
      anywhere and hence they are completely removed from the code.

    Improve logging on signature verification
    
    If xmlsec and vgauth are built inconsistently, xmlSecSize
    can differ between the two, which results in a key datastructure
    being a different size, and vgauth ends up looking in the
    wrong place in memory for the signature check status.
    
    Log the status, so that if its not one of the two
    expected values, we have some ideas of what went wrong.

    lib/file: Fix a memory leak in FileLock_Lock.
    
    Valgrind complained about a minor leak within FileLock_Lock when running
    test-vmx Firmware.Efi.QuickBoot .  FileLockScanner builds a list of "active
    locks" and traverses that list repeatedly, but whenever it decides to remove

    This change ensures that the list item is not leaked by Posix_Free()ing it
    once it is no longer needed.

    Hgfs Linux/OSX Server: fix write-only shares access check creating new files
    
    Linux and OS X Hgfs server has an incorrect failure status check when a
    user has a write-only share enabled.  In a write-only share any failure
    is mapped to EACESS unless the error is ENOENT when a new file is to be
    created.  The error check currently fails all errors when it should
    only allow creation of new files i.e., ENOENT with flags specifying
    O_CREAT.
    
    The check should be
       if (status == EACCES) goto exit

    [AppInfo] Tweak the gather loop only for a real config reload.
    
    The poll loop for the appInfo is being tweaked (destroyed and recreated)
    for every conf reload even when nothing related to appinfo changed.
    This may cause few scenarios where the 'application information'
    will never be collected inside the guest.  Fixed the code, to
    tweak the loop only when there is a real appinfo related config change
    in the tools.conf file.

    Use RPCI_UNKNOWN_COMMAND macro instead of hardcoded 'Unknown command" string.
    
    At few places in the code, the result from the RPC channel send APIs
    is explicitly compared with a harcoded "Unknown command" string.  We already
    have a well defined macro for that.  Changed the code to re-use the macro
    wherever possible.

    In error cases, RpcChannel Send APIs (RpcChannel_SendOneRaw,

    don't have to use 'hardcoded' messages and can reuse the MACROs.

    Use random poll-interval for appInfo on channel reset.
    
    In few workflows like instant clone, when a large number of VMs are
    cloned at the same time, if the appinfo plugin runs at the same time
    in all the VMs, the underlying ESXi may encounter heavy load.  To
    avoid these situations, a random poll interval should be used
    for the appinfo whenever applicable workflows are detected.
    
    Detecting a 'rpc channel reset' is a simple approach to detect.
    
    In this changeset, add the following changes:
    
    - Added a new callback function for the 'rpc channel reset'.  If
    the rpc channel is reset, a new random poll interval is calculated
    and poll timer is adjusted accordingly.  If the existing appinfo
    poll interval is greater than the minimum interval of 30 seconds,
    random interval will be generated between 30 and appinfopollinterval.
    If the existing poll interval is less than the minimum 30 seconds
    time, then random interval will not be changed.
    
    - Code refactoring for few functions.
    - Changed one global variable as static.
    - Added few debug/info log messages.

    Make Backdoor fallback temporary.
    
    When RpcOut falls to Backdoor, it stays with Backdoor
    permanently for the life of vmtoolsd service.  It is a
    long standing bug in the reset handling code.  Typically,
    channel type is not changed during reset.  Our reset
    handling code can either keep the channel type same or
    switch it from vsocket to Backdoor, but it can't do other
    way.  Though it is supposed to switch to vsocket on reset
    caused by events like vmtoolsd being restarted or VMX
    breaking the channel for some VM management operation.
    With this change when we start the channel, we always
    try vsocket first unless Backdoor is enforced by the
    caller.
    
    Using Backdoor for too long is not desirable because
    privileged RPCs can't be used on such channel.  So, we
    need to retry switching the channel back to vsocket
    periodically.  We don't want to try vsocket on every
    RpcChannel_Send call because that adds to overhead and
    increases the latency of RpcChannel_Send due to connection
    timeouts.  So, we retry vsocket with a backoff delay
    between 2sec-5min.
    
    As some RpcChannel callers intend to use Backdoor channel
    we need to differentiate between such usage from the
    callers that create vsocket channel and fallback to
    Backdoor.  Therefore, introduced a concept of mutable
    channel.  The vsocket channel is mutable as it can fallback
    to Backdoor and restore vsocket.  However, if a caller
    creates Backdoor channel, it will not be mutable and
    stay with Backdoor for its lifetime.
    
    As vmxLogger frequently connects and disconnects the
    channel for every log message and does not use any
    privileged RPC, so make it use Backdoor channel
    permanently to avoid frequent vsocket connections.
    
    Additionally, removed the redundant 'stopRpcOut' interface
    and renamed 'onStartErr' to 'destroy'.

    Add a Coverity annotation.
    
    The Coverity scan of open-vm-tools reports an out-of-bounds access
    issue in Util_BacktraceWithFunc.  This is intentional, to compute
    the base pointer for a stack trace.

    lib/unicode/unicodeSimpleTypes.c: fix leak on exit
    
    The hashtable used for encoding name -> IANA table index
    lookups was not getting freed.
    
    Also, HashTable_AllocOnce() incorrectly instructs
    the hashtable to clear its clientData, which contains
    an integer index and not a pointer, using "free".

commit ef20d06e9b2e3fbe8e7f6f709c4707ebf7c57d72

Date:   Wed Apr 1 11:31:36 2020 -0700

    Annotate a Coverity false positive.
    
    The open-vm-tools Coverity scan reports a NULL pointer dereference
    for the variable untrustedCerts.  However, untrustedCerts is NULL
    only if no untrusted certs are found, in which case the code that
    dereferences untrustedCerts isn't executed.

       is "VGAuthCli"
    3. Move I18n init up to fix variable localization issue

	Other changes not captured in the git logs:

	* Resync with internal dev branch (2009.08.24)

	* hgfsmounter/hgfsmounter.c: allow hgfs users to set ttl to 0 at mount time.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, lib/include/conf.h, lib/include/netutil.h,
	  lib/include/procMgr.h, lib/include/system.h, lib/vixTools/vixTools.c,
	  lib/vmCheck/vmcheck.c: remove (now unused) Netware checks.

	* lib/message/*, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/Makefile,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/Makefile.*, modules/solaris/vmhgfs/Makefile: remove
	  unused message transport abstraction. The rpcChannel library is now used to
	  do RPC abstraction.

	* modules/*/vmmemctl/*: refactor of the vmmemctl module as part of adding
	  support for Mac OS guests.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c: don't clobber RESERVATION_CONFLICT sdstat
	  up from linux pvscsi driver.

	* modules/linux/shared/*: VMCI changes unrelated to the guest driver.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c: fix the case
	  where two directories refer to the same inode.

	* scripts/linux/*: support older versions of NetworkManager.

2009-08-24	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.08.19)

	* configure.ac: remove support for Linux kernels < 2.6.9.

	* lib/include/vmtools.h, libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c, doc/api/services/util.txt:
	  add new log handled that allows appending to existing log files, and fix
	  an issue where old log files would be "rotated" whenever the config file
	  was reloaded.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c, lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c,
	  lib/include/appUtil.h: fix compilation issues on FreeBSD when unity
	  was enabled.

	* lib/dnd/dndLinux.c, lib/include/vmblock_user.h, tests/testVmblock/*: add
	  vmblock tests and, as part of the change, do some refactoring of vmblock
	  related functions.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/*,
	  toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c, toolbox/toolboxShrink.c: refactor the wiper
	  structures so that they behave the same on Win32 and other platforms, and
	  also reuse data structures already in use by other parts of the code. This
	  fixes an "use after free" issue that toolbox-cmd had on Win32.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoInt.h,
	  lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c, lib/guestRpc/nicinfo.x,
	  lib/include/guestInfo.h, lib/include/netutil.h, lib/include/slashProc.h,
	  lib/netutil/netUtilLinux.c, lib/slashProc/*,
	  services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: add support for sending more
	  network-related information to the host, such as routing tables and name
	  servers.

	* lib/hgfsBd/hgfsBd.c: don't log RPC errors when HGFS is disabled.

	* lib/hgfsHelper/*, lib/include/hgfsHelper.h, lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: new
	  library with functions to query information about HGFS; expose some HGFS
	  properties through VIX.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/hgfsServerPolicyGuest/hgfsServerPolicyGuest.c,
	  lib/include/hgfsServerPolicy.h: fix checking of whether an object belongs
	  to a particular share; this was causing issues with invalid information
	  being returned in certain cases.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*, lib/include/hgfsProto.h: changes to support new VIX API
	  calls (mostly affecting Win32 only).

	* lib/include/guestCaps.h, lib/include/unityCommon.h: add boilerplate for new
	  RPCs for setting windows as sticky / non-sticky (not yet implemented).

	* lib/include/hgfsProto.h: new definitions for the next version of the HGFS
	  protocol.

	* lib/include/xdrutil.h: make XDRUTIL_ARRAYAPPEND() more type-safe when using
	  GCC.

	* lib/misc/codesetOld.c: fix some issues with UTF16 -> UTF8 conversion.

	* lib/rpcChannel/rpcChannel.c, libvmtools/signalSource.c,
	  libvmtools/vmtools.c, libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: g_assert -> ASSERT.

	* lib/unityWindowTracker/unityWindowTracker.c: fix issue with z-ordering of
	  modal dialogs.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: fix some old config translation issues.

	* modules/freebsd/shared/*, modules/freebsd/vmblock/*: make vmblock work on
	  FreeBSD 8.

	* modules/freebsd/vmmemctl/*, modules/linux/vmmemctl/*,
	  modules/solaris/vmmemctl/*, : refactoring and code changes to support the
	  driver on Mac OS X.

	* modules/linux/vmblock/*, modules/linux/vmci/*, modules/linux/vsock/linux/*:
	  remove compatibility code for older kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: fix memory leak in HgfsAccessInt().

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: fix kunmap usage in vmxnet3_shm, and reset the
	  shared pages when the char device is closed.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.{c,h}, modules/linux/vsock/linux/util.c:
	  add vsock protocol negotiation for notifyOn ops. This allows the driver to
	  negotiate with the remove end which version of the notification protocol to
	  use.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/notify.c, modules/linux/vsock/linux/notify.h,
	  modules/linux/vsock/linux/notifyQState.c,
	  modules/linux/vsock/linux/vsockPacket.h: add pktOn protocol. This new
	  protocol improves performance by detecting changes in the queue state
	  instead of sending WAITING_READ and WAITING_WRITE packets.

	* services/plugins/hgfsServer/hgfsPlugin.c,
	  services/plugins/resolutionSet/resolutionSet.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: load plugins even when an RPC channel cannot
	  be instantiated (i.e., when running outside of a virtual machine); this
	  allows plugins to perform actions (at load time) also when running outside
	  virtual machines (e.g., to undo some configuration done when the OS was run
	  in a VM).

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c, services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: handle SIGHUP differently; instead of
	  stopping the service, just re-load the config data. This should make it
	  easier to integrate the tools service with other tools such as logrotate.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c, toolbox/toolboxcmd-stat.c: remove memory info query,
	  which didn't really return useful information.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.cpp: if the clipboard/primary with most recent
	  timestamp has no data on it, try the other before giving up during
	  copy/paste.

2009-07-22	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.07.17)

	* configure.ac: fix detection of "dot" and its usage in the doxygen config
	  file.

	* configure.ac, libguestlib/Makefile.am, libguestlib/vmguestlib.pc.in:
	  install vmguestlib headers and add new pkgconfig script.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/include/dndBase.h, vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}:
	  fix an issue where the DnD code would prevent drops to other windows in
	  Unity mode, instead of just intercepting drops to the desktop.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/dndGuest/dndRpc.hh, lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc,
	  lib/include/dndBase.h, vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}: fix an issue where the
	  host Unity code would cause an undesired drop event.

	* lib/dndGuest/dnd.{cc,hh}, lib/dndGuest/dndRpc.hh, lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc,
	  lib/include/dndBase.h: cleanup mouse simulation code, and fix an issue
	  where a drag would be canceled if the contents were dragged out of a guest
	  and then back in.

	* lib/dndGuest/dndRpcV3.cc, vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.cpp,
	  vmware-user/dndUI.cpp, vmware-user/dndUI.h, vmware-user/dragDetWnd.cpp,
	  vmware-user/dragDetWnd.h: several DnD fixes; make the DnD code behave
	  more like other GTK applications (based on analysing the flow of signals
	  on a test widget), and get rid of one of the detection windows, merging
	  both the Unity and non-Unity windows. Also, some code refactoring.

	* lib/ghIntegration/*, lib/guestRpc/*, lib/include/guestCaps.h,
	  lib/include/unityCommon.h: add stubs for a few new GHI functions (setting
	  window focus, tray icon updates and enhanced app info) - currently only
	  implemented on Win32.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: examine WM_CLASS when determining
	  which DE Tools are running in. The previous code was failing to show a
	  few entries set as "OnlyShowIn=xxx" because checking WM_NAME wasn't enough
	  to properly detect the desktop environment in certain cases.

	* lib/guestApp/guestAppPosixX11.c: use gconftool-2 to detect the user's
	  browser, since gnome-open fails to open "file://" URLs which contain query
	  strings. Also, use "kde-open" when running under KDE.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c:
	  allow shrinking LVM partitions.

	* lib/include/appUtil.h: partial refactoring of icon retrieval code.

	* lib/include/dbllnklst.h, lib/misc/dbllnklst.c: inline linked list
	  functions.

	* lib/include/guest_os.h, lib/misc/hostinfoPosix.c: add a couple of
	  distros to the known distro list.

	* lib/include/netutil.h, lib/netUtil/netUtilLinux.c: add Linux interface
	  name, index lookup routines.

	* lib/include/system.h, lib/system/systemLinux.c,
	  services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c: fixes a few bugs in the backwards
	  time sync code, mostly due to unit mismatches.

	* lib/include/unityWindowTracker.h, lib/unity/unity.c,
	  lib/unity/unityPlatform.h, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unityWindowTracker/unityWindowTracker.c: expose two new properties in
	  the window tracker to save an RPC to retrieve those properties.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsCoreInt.h: add
	  support for "application providers", which allow plugins to add support to
	  new kinds of application frameworks through vmtoolsd.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: only enable GIO channels when Unity is
	  actually active.

	* lib/unity/*: cleanup old GTK1 code.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: don't complain if config file is empty.

	* modules/linux/dkms.conf, modules/linux/dkms.sh: fix dkms.conf, and provide
	  a script to create a dkms tree from open-vm-tools.

	* modules/linux/shared/vmci_queue_pair.h, modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c:
	  remove two (now) unneeded functions.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: code cleanups, properly initialize the list head,
	  and allow receives to timeout so that hibernation works.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_drv.c: fix
	  drivers for kernels 2.6.29+.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: add shared memory support for faster communication
	  between user space and the device backend; this doesn't affect the regular
	  driver functionality, but is used by some VMware code not part of Tools.

	* modules/linux/vsock/*: fix an issue where it was possible for users to send
	  VMCI datagrams directly to the hypervisor.

	* scripts/common/vmware-user.desktop: work around a bug in KDE where desktop
	  files with "NoDisplay" fail to autostart.

	* scripts/freebsd/suspend-vm-default: use netif to bring down interfaces,
	  since dhclient doesn't understand "-r" in the default install.

	* services/plugins/vmbackup/*: add some new code used by enhancements being
	  done in the Win32 version of the plugin.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: fix running in background when executing
	  vmtoolsd while relying on PATH.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am: point to the correct plugin install
	  directory.

	* toolbox/*: better command line handling in the CLI utility, plus some code
	  cleanup.

	* vmware-user/copyPaste.c, vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.cpp,
	  vmware-user/copyPasteDnDWrapper.h, vmware-user/dnd.c: properly unregister
	  RPCs to avoid multiple registrations (and the ensuing ASSERT) in certain
	  cases.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h}: change way data is retrieved from the
	  clipboard, using the gtk+ clipboard wait APIs (which turn out to be more
	  reliable than the previous approach).

2009-06-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.06.15)

	* docs/api/Makefile.am: replace all variables in the doxygen conf file with
	  the correct values.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c: try alternate file extensions during icon search.
	  Sometimes a package lists its icon as icon-foo.png, but the package didn't
	  include icon-foo.png.	 Instead, it included icon-foo.xpm.	 Ex: Ubuntu
	  8.04's hwtest.

	* lib/guestApp/guestAppPosixX11.c: change detection of the default browser so
	  that the new help system works; the help files are not yet available in
	  open-vm-tools.

	* lib/hgfs/*, lib/include/cpName.h, lib/include/cpNameLite.h,
	  lib/include/hgfsUtil.h: avoid compiling certain parts of the source in
	  kernel modules.

	* lib/hgfsServer/*: return correct error when files / directories don't
	  exist.

	* lib/include/hgfsChannel.h, modules/linux/vmhgfs/*: added support for vsock
	  channel for HGFS.

	* lib/include/util.h, lib/misc/utilMem.c: un-inline a bunch of functions to
	  reduce the size of binaries.

	* lib/include/vm_tools_version.h: bumped Tools version.

	* lib/resolution/resolutionX11.c: fix for issue where the host would send
	  a "topology set" command with a top-left corner that was not (0, 0) and
	  cause the screen to be reconfigured in the wrong way.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c: check for errors in calls to
	  XQueryTree.

	* lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c: check return of fgets() to avoid compiler warnings.

	* libvmtools/vmtools.c: fix initialization of wiper library on Win32.

	* modules/Makefile.am: install vsock header file on Linux.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/*, modules/linux/vmci/*, modules/linux/vsock/*:
	  changes related to 64-bit Mac drivers, don't affect either the FreeBSD
	  or Linux drivers.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/hgfs.h: removed duplicate file.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/module.h: fix issue where two files would get the
	  same inode number in some situations.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c: re-probe vmxnet2 device features on resume
	  from hibernate, to cover the case where a VM is resumed on a platform with
	  a different version of the device backend (bug #2209565).

	* scripts/resume-vm-default, scripts/suspend-vm-default: use NetworkManager
	  to handle networking where it is available.

	* services/plugins/hgfsServer/Makefile.am, services/plugins/vix/Makefile.am:
	  fix installation of vmusr plugins that are shared with vmsvc.

	* services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c: fix backwards time sync.

	* services/vmtoolsd/cmdLine.c, toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: print build number as
	  part of "-v" output.

	* toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c: correctly ignore unsupported partitions when
	  shrinking.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: changes for the new help system, not yet available
	  for open-vm-tools.

	* toolbox/toolboxInt.{c,h}, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: some code refactoring.

	* vmware-user/Makefile.am: fix linking when compiling without gtkmm.

2009-05-22	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.05.18)

	* configure.ac, m4/vmtools.m4: check for PAM and enable PAM support when
	  available.

	* configure.ac, services/plugins/*/Makefile.am, tests/*/Makefile.am: avoid
	  the "-rpath" hack to create plugins, using plugin_LTLIBRARIES instead (and
	  manually fixing things when necessary). Thanks to Dominique Leuenberger for
	  the suggestion (and sample patch).

	* docs/api/Makefile.am: fix doc target directories.

	* configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/deployPkg/*, lib/include/deployPkg.h:
	  remove the deployPkg code, which depends on some VMware code that is not
	  yet open source.

	* lib/backdoor/*, lib/hgfs/*, lib/hgfsBd/*, lib/include/*,
	  lib/include/compat/*, lib/message/*, lib/misc/dbllnklst.c,
	  lib/rpcOut/rpcout.c: as part of sharing code between user-level code and
	  kernel modules, some files have been tagged with more than one license.

	* lib/dndGuest/*, lib/include/dndBase.h, lib/include/dndMsg.h,
	  lib/include/unity*, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: implement mouse movement
	  from within the guest; this avoids a dependency on "unofficial" mouse APIs
	  in the VMware host code, making DnD more reliable, and makes a few things
	  (such as cancelling an ongoing DnD operation) easier.

	* lib/file/filePosix.c: make File_FullPath()'s behavior consistent when the
	  input path starts with a '/'.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegration.c: send more info about the "start menu"
	  contents to the host (only usable for Windows guests).

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: prettify the category names of menu
	  items. This is a temporary solution before actually reading this
	  information from .desktop files.

	* lib/guestApp/guestApp.c, libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c, lib/include/guestApp.h,
	  toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c, vmware-user/foreignVM*, vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp,
	  configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/include/socketMgr.h, lib/socketMgr.*:
	  remove code related to "foreign VM" support, which was never really used.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/include/wiper.h, lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c:
	  properly report disk info for LVM volumes.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsDirNotify*, lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c: add support
	  for directory / file monitoring. It's currently only implemented on
	  Mac OS X.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer*: fix issue where it was possible to
	  create a file on a read-only share on Windows hosts.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer*, lib/hgfsServerManagerGuest/*,
	  lib/include/hgfs*.h, services/plugins/hgfsServer/hgfsPlugin.c,
	  services/plugins/vix/foundryToolsDaemon.c: some refactoring caused by the
	  work to make HGFS support pluggable transports.

	* lib/include/procMgr.h, lib/procMgr/procMgrPosix.c:
	  remove ProcMgr_GetAsyncStatus().

	* lib/include/vmsupport.h, scripts/vm-support, xferlogs/xferlogs.c,
	  services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: new feature to automatically
	  collect support data from the guest from the VMware UI.

	* lib/panicDefault/*, lib/user/*: change file names to avoid clash with
	  another file (Mac OS linker doesn't really like that).

	* lib/rpcChannel/rpcChannel.c: try to reinitialize the outbound channel on
	  failure.

	* lib/vixTools/vixTools.c, lib/include/vixCommands.h,
	  lib/include/vixOpenSource.h: add backend for new VIX API call to list the
	  guest's filesystems.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: lazily open the log file, instead of opening it
	  during configuration of the log system. This way two processes can use the
	  same conf file and not overwrite each other's log files (assuming the conf
	  data is sane).

	* modules/Makefile.am, modules/linux/vmci/Makefile.kernel,
	  modules/linux/vsock/Makefile.kernel: don't store VMCI module symbols in
	  /tmp during build; this avoids a possible symlink attack that could cause
	  data to be overwritten when building open-vm-tools.

	* modules/*/*, vmblock-fuse/*: remove a lot of duplicated files by either
	  moving them to a shared location or reusing files that were already
	  available elsewhere.

	* modules/freebsd/vmblock/subr.c, modules/freebsd/vmblock/vmblock_k.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmblock/vnoops.c: fix a possible kernel crash caused by
	  trying to read / write to the mount point (something vmware-user does to
	  detect whether it's using fuse or non-fuse vmblock).

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/*: adds support for a generic msg framework that is
	  currently used to deliver hot-plug/unplug notifications; get rid of a few
	  divisions; fix a bug where pvscsi_probe could return 0 (aka success) if
	  a call to kmalloc() failed; remove a few unused fields.

	* modules/linux/shared/vmci*: mostly changes related to the host VMCI drivers
	  (removed user-level queue-pair daemon, added support for trusted VMCI
	  endpoints) to keep binary compatibility between the host and guest VMCI
	  drivers.

	* modules/linux/hgfs/inode.c: check host's access rights when checking file
	  permissions, so that permissions are correctly checked when the guest's
	  user id is different from the host's user id.

	* modules/linux/bdhandler.*, modules/linux/filesystem.c; modules/linux/tcp.*,
	  modules/linux/transport.*,: postpone opening the channels so that module
	  can load successfully even if shared folders are disabled on the host;
	  fix a synchronization problem between recv and close/open; allow
	  hibernation to work by timing out the recv thread; correctly handle
	  failures in recv, including injecting a dummy error to the pending
	  requests when the recv thread exits; move the recv code to the channel's
	  implementation so that it can be simpler.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c, modules/linux/shared/compat_pci.h: fix
	  Wake-On-LAN for 2.6.27 and newer Linux guests.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/*: changes to support trusted VMCI host apps;
	  pull out notification and stats logging code into their own files.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/vnode.c: do not substitute errors returned by
	  uiomove() calls with EIO, propagate returned error code (which is EFAULT)
	  up the stack.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am, scripts/common/linux/pam.d/vmtoolsd-x64,
	  scripts/common/linux/pam.d/64/vmtoolsd: install the 64-bit PAM config
	  file with the correct name.

	* services/plugins/powerOps/powerOps.c: fix running default scripts by
	  making sure the path to the script is absolute.

	* services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am, services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: use info
	  from the configure step to define the plugin path; this avoids requiring
	  a symlink to be placed in /etc/vmware-tools for vmtoolsd to be able to
	  find the plugins.

	* services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: send the build information to the host so
	  it's logged in the VM's logs.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c, toolbox/toolboxcmd-*, toolbox/toolboxCmdInt.h:
	  make string comparison case-insensitive on Win32.

	* toolbox/toolboxcmd-shrink.c: properly finish the shrinking process by
	  sending the "disk.shrink" RPC to the host.

	* toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix showing default settings for power ops
	  scripts (should show default script enabled, not script disabled).

	* vmblock-fuse/Makefile.am: fix compilation on FreeBSD.

	* vmware-user/copyPasteUI.cpp: disallow copy-paste text of size greater than
	  4MB, instead of truncating the data.

	* vmware-user/dndUI.*, lib/dndGuest/dnd.cc, lib/include/dndBase.h: remove
	  drag timeout callback (which was not needed), and add new signal to
	  indicate that a GH DnD was cancelled.

	* vmware-user/Makefile.am: remove C++ link hack (not needed now since
	  vmware-user has C++ code already).

2009-04-23	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.04.17)

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, docs/*: build API docs for vmtools; the
	  documentation files are provided under a BSD-style license.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, guestd/*, lib/Makefile.am, lib/guestInfo/*,
	  lib/include/vmbackup_def.h, lib/include/vmBackup.h, lib/vmBackupLib/*,
	  libvmtools/Makefile.am, services/plugins/vmbackup/vmbackup_def.h: remove
	  guestd from open-vm-tools, and clean up code in other places that was only
	  there because of guestd.

	* configure.ac, modules/solaris/vmblock/*, modules/solaris/vmmemctl/*: add
	  Solaris vmblock and vmmemctl driver sources. The vmmemctl module also
	  includes a user-level daemon (vmmemctld.c).

	* lib/conf/conf.c, lib/include/conf.h, libvmtools/vmtoolsConfig.c: remove
	  unused config options.

	* lib/deployPkg/toolsDeployPkg.h: code refactoring.

	* lib/dnd/dndClipboard.c: if size of clipboard exceeds the maximum backdoor
	  packet size, only keep text data (dropping the RTF data).

	* lib/dnd/dndLinux.c, lib/include/dnd.h, lib/include/vmblock.h,
	  vmware-user/copyPaste.c, vmware-user/dnd.c, vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp,
	  vmware-user/vmwareuserint.h, vmware-user-suid-wrapper/main.c: detect
	  whether plain vmblock or vmblock-fuse is being used, allowing the same
	  executable to be used with either.

	* lib/dndGuest/*, vmware-user/copyPaseDnDWrapper.{cpp,h},
	  vmware-user/dndUI.{cpp,h}, vmware-user/dragDetWnd.{cpp,h}:
	  vmware-user/vmware-user.cpp: more DnD V3 protocol work.

	* lib/ghIntegration/*, lib/include/guestCaps.h, lib/include/unityCommon.h:
	  work related to mapping Outlook folders over HGFS and exposing the Windows
	  Recycle Bin to the host (doesn't really affect open-vm-tools).

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: restore the native environment when
	  launching external applications. This doesn't really affect open-vm-tools.

	* lib/guestRpc/*, vmware-user/copyPasteUI.{cpp,h}: implement RTF and file
	  contents copy & paste.

	* lib/include/circList.h, lib/include/vm_basic_math.h,
	  lib/include/vm_device_version.h, modules/linux/*, modules/Makefile.am:
	  changes to share files between the user space code and the kernel code,
	  instead of duplicating the same source files in different places.

	* lib/include/rpcChannel.h, lib/rpcChannel/*, tests/testDebug/testDebug.c,
	  test/vmrpcdbg/debugChannel.c: some code cleanup, and fix crash when dealing
	  with multiple reset messages.

	* lib/include/system.h, lib/system/systemLinux.c,
	  services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: remove System_Daemon() (replaced with
	  Hostinfo_Daemonize()).

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h, lib/unity/*: ressurrect UNITY_RPC_WINDOW_SHOW
	  and UNITY_RPC_WINDOW_HIDE RPCs.

	* lib/procMgr/procMgrPosix.c: fix ProcMgr_IsProcessRunning().

	* lib/system/systemLinux.c: fix shutdown / reboot commands on Solaris; fix
	  rebuilding of native environment from variables set by VMware scripts (this
	  last one doesn't really affect open-vm-tools).

	* lib/unicode/unicodeSimpleTypes.c: speed up UnicodeIANALookup, and fix case
	  where C++ constructors could call UnicodeIANALookup before Unicode_Init()
	  was called by lazily creating the internal cache.

	* libguestlib/*: link libguestlib against libvmtools. This avoids having
	  two definitions of certain symbols (like Debug()) when an application
	  links to both libraries.

	* modules/linux/vmblock/linux/control.c: only set directory entry owner when
	  needed.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/bdhandler.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/dir.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/file.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/filesystem.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/fsutil.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/inode.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/module.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/request.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/super.c,
	  modules/linux/vmhgfs/tcp.{c,h}, modules/linux/vmhgfs/transport.{c,h}:
	  cleanup use of atomic variables in HGFS; add a transport abstraction layer,
	  and add an initial version of a socket-based transport (not yet stable and
	  not yet supported by any released VMware product).

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: fix build on kernel 2.6.29.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_vsock.c: export more functions to other kernel
	  modules; some changes to statistics gathering code.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/filesystem.c: make module loadable on Solaris 9.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/vnode.c: unify mapping of HGFS to Solaris error
	  codes.

	* scripts/*: restart network before running user scripts in resume scripts.

	* services/plugin/powerOps/powerOps.c: fix running default power scripts.

	* services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: better error logging.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: fix help string.

	* vmblock-fuse/block.c: fix vmblock-fuse compilation on FreeBSD.

2009-03-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.03.13)

	* configure.ac: check for FreeBSD kernel tree when building modules; warn
	  about which version of make to use when building kernel modules on FreeBSD
	  and Solaris; add compiler defines for identifying Solaris 9 and 11.

	* configure.ac, modules/Makefile.am: handle SYSDIR on FreeBSD.

	* guestd/main.c, modules/solaris/vmhgfs/Makefile: remove HGFS-related that
	  is now obsolete with the recent changes to the HGFS module on Solaris.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c: default to the configuration dir when the power
	  script path is not absolute.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, lib/include/guestInfo.h, lib/netUtil/netUtilLinux.c:
	  handle case when all network interfaces have been disabled and send an
	  "unknown" IP address to the host.

	* guestd/toolsDaemon.c, services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: always send
	  TOOLS_VERSION_UNMANAGED from an open-vm-tools build, so there's no need for
	  a config file option anymore.

	* hgfsclient/*: make it link to libvmtools to avoid code duplication.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtil.c: update list of "skippable" apps when figuring out
	  an application's path.

	* lib/auth/authPosix.c, scripts/linux/pam.d/*, guestd/Makefile.am,
	  services/vmtoolsd/Makefile.am : change the name of the PAM application to
	  "vmtoolsd" to reflect the new service name.

	* lib/dnd/dndFileContentsUtil.h, lib/dnd/dndInt.h, lib/dndGuest/*.hh, and
	  corresponding files in lib/include: relocate private headers.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegration.c, lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationInt.h,
	  lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c, lib/include/unityCommon.h: glue code
	  for Outlook mirrored folder, which does not affect open-vm-tools.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/include/vmGuestLib.h,
	  libguestlib/vmGuestLib.c: add new guestlib counters.

	* lib/include/conf.h, toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: remove the need for the
	  "helpdir" config option; this doesn't really affect open-vm-tools since the
	  help files are not yet included.

	* lib/include/guest_os.h, lib/misc/hostinfoPosix.c: more guest OS names; fix
	  name used to identify Solaris to match what VMware's host code expects.

	* lib/include/guestStats.h: documentation changes.

	* lib/include/hostinfo.h, lib/user/hostinfoPosix.c: add a new function that
	  behaves like daemon(3), but is more Mac OS-friendly.

	* lib/include/toolsLogger.h, lib/Makefile.am, lib/toolsLogger/*: removed
	  library, which is not used anymore.

	* lib/include/vm_basic_types.h, lib/misc/timeutil.c: fixes to compile under

	* lib/misc/posixPosix.c: fix off-by-one error.

	* lib/unity/unity.c, lib/unity/unityPlatform.h, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c,
	  lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c: always send Unity updates using RPCI;
	  this avoids a possible race between replying to an incoming RPC and sending
	  an Unity update from a different thread; also, API documentation updates.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: verify the DnD detection window was
	  initialized before actually using it.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c:
	  reset _NET_WM_DESKTOP as necessary before exiting Unity; this could cause
	  guest taskbars to disappear when in Unity mode.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unity/unityX11.h: examine WM_CLIENT_LEADER when gathering application
	  information; certain applications use this property to define the window
	  where the WM_COMMAND property should be.

	* lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: do not follow symlinks when deleting files in the
	  guest using the VIX API.

	* libvmtools/vmtools.c, libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: allow the logging subsystem
	  to be re-configured, and clean up the logging data when unloading the
	  library; allow ${USER} and ${PID} to be used in log file paths.

	* modules/freebsd/vmblock/subr.c, modules/freebsd/vmblock/vnops.c: fix kernel
	  panic on FreeBSD 7.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile: remove GCC version check.

	* modules/linux/*/compat_wait.h: fix COMPAT_DEFINE_WAIT for "vanilla" 2.4
	  kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/Makefile.normal: fix build of HGFS module on 2.4
	  kernels.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet/*, modules/linux/vmxnet3/*: avoid using compat
	  functions when they're not needed; add compatibility functions for
	  newer Linux kernels.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.c: fix two races; one when the socket
	  state changed between calls to VSockVmciRecvStreamCB and
	  VSockVmciRecvPktWork, and another when trying to read from the socket after
	  a RST arrived after the socket got a detach notification.

	* modules/solaris/vmxnet3/*: add Solaris vmxnet3 driver.

	* rpctool/*: add "rpctool", a simple, stand-alone tool to send RPC commands
	  to the host software.

	* services/plugins/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c: don't cache configuration
	  data.

	* services/plugins/guestInfo/perfMonLinux.c: fix problem with overwriting
	  flags after GuestInfoMonitorReadMeminfo() was called. (Same as fix to
	  lib/guestInfo on previous release.)

	* services/plugins/powerOps/powerOps.c: handle power ops-related options
	  sent from the host.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainLoop.c: handle re-loading the configuration file.

	* services/vmtoolsd/mainPosix.c: exec after forking on Mac OS, since
	  CoreFoundation classes don't work after a fork.

	* services/vmtoolsd/pluginMgr.c: allow both 32 and 64 bit plugins to be
	  installed on Solaris by loading them from the appropriate directory;
	  add library loading code that is not really needed (nor used) in
	  open-vm-tools.

	* services/vmtoolsd/toolsRpc.c: send another "capability" the host expects
	  from Tools.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: add F1 shortcut to invoke help.

	* toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix issue with freeing data that should not be
	  freed.

	* vmware-user/*: implement the new DnD protocol (V3).


2009-02-18	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.02.13)

	* configure.ac, m4/vmtools.m4: clean up a lot of the library detection code.

	* configure.ac: remove support for gtk+ 1.2 (code already depended on it in
	  any case); enforce need for glib 2.6.0 or later due to new code being
	  added; add detection for gtkmm; check for C++ compiler when it's needed;
	  reorder the include path to avoid clashing with system headers in some
	  situations.

	* guestd/foundryToolsDaemon.*, vmware-user/foundryToolsDaemon.*,
	  guestd/Makefile.am, vmware-user/Makefile.am: moved shared source files to
	  a new place to avoid duplication.

	* hgfsmounter/hgfsmounter.c: add support for Solaris.

	* lib/appUtil/appUtilX11.c: fix loading of icons when the name has a period.

	* lib/dnd/dndClipboard.c, lib/dnd/dndInt.h, lib/dnd/dndMsg.c,

	  lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c, */hgfsProto.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnops.c, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnopscommon.{c,h}:
	  don't trust the local VFS layer, check the HGFS server to see if an
	  operation would succeed.

	* lib/include/rpcChannel.h, lib/rpcChannel/*: add new Guest RPC channel
	  abstraction library used by the new "core services" code.

	* lib/include/vmrpcdbg.h, tests/*: add test code from the "core services"
	  project.

	* lib/include/vmtoolsApp.h, lib/include/vmtoolsd_version.h,
	  services/vmtoolsd/*: add "vmtoolsd", the new service "shell" used in the
	  "core services" project.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c: don't send initial "region" updates for
	  shaped windows. This works around an issue where resizing a shaped window
	  would not work as expected in Unity mode.

	* lib/wiper/wiperPosix.c: fix major number detection for disks on newer Linux
	  kernels.

	* libvmtools/Makefile.am: link more libraries needed by vmtoolsd and the new
	  plugins.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c, modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi_version.h: use
	  PCI-specific memory allocation functions and update driver version.

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c: disable queue pair support in the host
	  version of the driver on older Linux kernels. This doesn't affect the
	  guest driver.

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmci_queue_pair.h: implement MSG_PEEK support on
	  Linux driver.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/bdhandler.c, modules/linux/vmhgfs/compat_sched.h,
	  modules/linux/vmmemctl/os.c: fix issue with HGFS module interfering with

	  of gcc (bug #2531283).

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/*: move backdoor handling code to the HGFS driver;
	  this makes the user-level code to handle the driver (currently in
	  vmware-guestd) obsolete.

	* modules/solaris/vmxnet/*: add vmxnet driver for Solaris, under the CDDL.

	* services/plugins/*: add all currently available "core services" plugins.
	  The current set of plugins provide the functionality available in
	  vmware-guestd; there are a few plugins that replace functionality from
	  vmware-user, but not all features are ported yet (and vmtoolsd - with
	  vmware-user plugins - and vmware-user cannot run at the same time).

	* toolbox/toolboxAbout.c: fix the copyright character.

	* toolbox/toolbox-cmd.c: reword a few messages, fix typos.

	* toolbox/toolboxCmdInt.h, toolbox/toolboxcmd-record.c,
	  toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c, toolbox/toolboxRecord.c: remove the "record"
	  functionality from tools (due to internal request).

	* toolbox/toolboxInt.c, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c, toolbox/toolbox-scripts.c:
	  changes to use the new config file format used by the "core services" code.

	* */Makefile.am: make sure 'rm' and 'mv' are being used instead of $(RM) and
	  $(MV) (which are not defined by automake; bug #2492040).

2009-01-21	Marcelo Vanzin	 <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2009.01.19)

	* configure.ac: detect the presence of FUSE libraries.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: compile kernel modules for Solaris, and
	  vmblock-fuse module if FUSE is available.

	* lib/ghIntegration/ghIntegrationX11.c: retrieved localized application
	  names.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c,
	  lib/include/hostinfo.h, lib/misc/hostinfo_misc.c, lib/misc/hostinfoPosic.c,
	  lib/vixTools/vixTools.c: refactoring to move code shared with other VMware
	  products to a common library.

	* lib/guestRpc/guestlibV3.x, lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am,
	  lib/include/vmGuestLib.h, libguestlib/*: add new iteration of the
	  "guestlib" protocol. This is a more extensible solution than the current
	  protocol, and should make it easier to add new information when needed.

	* lib/include/dynarray.h, lib/include/dynbuf.h, lib/misc/dynarray.c,
	  lib/misc/dynbuf.c: make some DynArray/DynBuf functions inline for speed.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h: more documentation about the Unity protocol.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: fix Unity<->guest desktop ID mappings.

	* libvmtools/vmtoolsLog.c: change the way log domains are configured; now
	  sub-domains inherit the default handler for the app if no handler is
	  specified.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.c, modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/state.h,
	  modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/vnopscommon.{c,h}: implement support for mmap on
	  the Mac OS driver, which allows running executables from an HGFS
	  share. The FreeBSD module still does not support this functionality.

	* modules/freebsd/vmhgfs/transport.{c,h}: refactoring for sharing structure
	  definitions.

	* modules/linux/pvscsi/pvscsi.c, modules/linux/vmblock/linux/module.c,
	  modules/linux/vmci/vmci_drv.c, modules/linux/hgfs/module.c,
	  modules/linux/vmmemctl/os.c, modules/linux/vmsync/sync.c,
	  modules/linux/vmxnet/vmxnet.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c: add support
	  for Novell's proprietary module info tag ("supported").

	* modules/linux/vmci/vmciKernelIf.c: add support for VMCI queue pairs on
	  the host. This does not affect the driver when it runs inside virtual
	  machines.

	* modules/linux/vmci/*.h, modules/linux/vsock/*.h: some changes in the common
	  code to support Mac OS X, and also queue pairs on the Solaris VMCI module.

	* modules/linux/vsock/af_vsock.{c,h}: add functions for registering with
	  the vsock driver from within the kernel.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile: add $(LINUXINCLUDE) to the compiler flags; this
	  allows compiling the modules against recent kernels which removed that
	  from $(KBUILD_CPPFLAGS).

	* modules/Makefile.am: add support for compiling Solaris kernel modules.

	* modules/solaris/vmhgfs/*: initial release of the Solaris HGFS driver in
	  open-vm-tools. Driver is licensed under the CDDL 1.0.

	* vmblock-fuse/*: add the user-level implementation of the vmblock driver,
	  which is build on top of FUSE, to open-vm-tools. vmware-user hasn't yet
	  been modified to use this version of vmblock.

	* vmware-user/copyPaseV3.h: new header introduced during development of the
	  next version of copy paste / DnD for X11 platforms.


2008-11-23  Marcelo Vanzin  <mvanzin@vmware.com>
	* Resync with internal trunk (2008.12.19)

	* configure.ac, */Makefile.am: standardize on using libtool archives for
	  the libraries. This also means several makefiles were removed, since
	  there's no need to build two archives of the same library anymore.

	* configure.ac: add logic to detect glib 2.6; this is the minimum version
	  required by the "Core Services" project. Currently it's an optional
	  dependency.

	* configure.ac: disable Unity when user specifies --disable-multimon.

	* configure.ac: actually build the pvscsi modules if the detected kernel
	  version supports it.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, lib/guestInfo/Makefile.am,
	  lib/stubs/Makefile.am, libvmtools/*, lib/include/vmtools.h: add the
	  "vmtools" shared library used in the "Core Services" project. The library
	  is a collection of a lot of other libraries used by most VMware Tools
	  programs, and adds some functionality on top of glib that is used in the
	  "Core Services" project. Currently no other components from that project
	  are available as part of open-vm-tools.

	* lib/deployPkg/deployPkgLog.h, lib/deployPkg/toolsDeployPkg.h: moved private
	  headers out of the public header directory.

	* lib/guestRpc/Makefile.am, modules/Makefile.am: fix the makefiles so that
	  it's possible to build open-vm-tools from a directory different from the
	  source dir.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServer.c: changes to support aliases on Mac OS hosts.

	* lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c: changes to map Windows attributes to
	  Mac OS FileInfo.

	* lib/include/circList.h: removed unused file.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h, lib/unity/unity.c: changes to add documentation
	  to various application RPCs used in Tools.

	* lib/misc/posixPosix.c, toolbox/toolboxScripts.c: fix include path for
	  syslimits.h on FreeBSD.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11.c: better detection of the guest's work area
	  boundaries; fixes a problem when dragging a Window in Unity mode with
	  the host's task bar on the left/right of screen would result in weird
	  behavior.

	* lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Settings.c, lib/unity/unityPlatformX11Window.c,
	  lib/unity/unityX11.h: preserve the _NET_WM_DESKTOP setting when hiding
	  windows; this fixes a problem where hiding a panel and later restoring it
	  would result in the wrong _NET_WM_DESKTOP property being set for the panel,
	  causing it to only display on the first virtual desktop.

	* modules/linux/vmci/*: minor changes related to internal development of the
	  Mac OS drivers.

	* modules/linux/vmhgfs/page.c: fix HGFS driver for kernel 2.6.28.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/af_vsock.c: added code to gather some performance
	  statistics for the driver.

	* toolbox/toolbox-gtk.c: a few fixes to the help functionality.

	* vmware-user/vmware-user.c, vmware-user-suid-wrapper/main.c: change the
	  "blockFd" argument to have an extra dash so it follows the convention of
	  common command line parsing libraries.

	* Other bug fixes and changes in shared code that don't affect open-vm-tools.

	  lib/include/hgfsEscape.h, lib/include/staticEscape.h, modules/*/vmhgfs/*,
	  vmware-user/dnd.c: refactor the HGFS character escaping code; escape
	  invalid characters when the sender allows characters in the file name that
	  the receiver does not allow.

   * lib/hgfsServer/hgfsServerLinux.c: return proper error code when the
     remote path points to a non-existent directory.

     absolute mode, which allows for auto grab / auto ungrab to work.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfo.c, lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPosix.c,
     lib/guestRpc/nicinfo.x: provide the prefix length of an IPv6 address in a
     separate field of the NicInfo struct.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfoPerfMonLinux.c: reduce log spew.

	* lib/guestInfo/guestInfoServer.c, lib/include/guestInfo.h: changes related
	  to how the VMware code in the host handles Tools version information.

	* lib/include/unityCommon.h: changes related to documenting the Unity API.

	* lib/include/unity.h, lib/unity/*: remove a few unused RPCs, add a new

	  device.

	* modules/linux/*/Makefile, modules/linux/vmci/Makefile.kernel,
	  modules/linux/vsock/Makefile.kernel: add support for exporing symbols,
	  needed for dependent modules to load if a kernel >= 2.6.26 is compiled
	  with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS. Make the vsock module reference the vmci module's
	  symbols.

	* modules/vmmemctl/freebsd/os.c: add sysctl to get driver status. Information
	  can be retrieved with "sysctl vm.vmmemctl".

   * modules/linux/vmci/vmci_defs.h, modules/linux/vmci/vmci_call_defs.h,
     modules/linux/vsock/vmciHostKernelAPI.h: changes related to VMCI work
     on VMware ESX.

	* modules/linux/vsock/linux/*: improve performance of some applications by
	  improving the poll behavior and sending less packets when waiting
	  for a response.

   * modules/linux/vmsnc/sync.c: fix panic on kernels < 2.6.20.

	* modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3.c, modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_int.h,
     modules/linux/vmxnet3/vmxnet3_version.h: inherit net device features to
     avoid having the kernel setting the PSH flag on every TCP packet (among
     other issues).

	* modules/*/*/*: Reflected changes from elsewhere.

	* scripts/common/vmware-user.desktop: add missing "Type" information; fixes

	bits and pieces in our own vm_procps.h (Sourceforge bug 1960947).

	* hgfsmounter/Makefile.am: Removed chown calls. Only call chmod
	if we're running as root (requested by Dennis Leroy).
